In particular, present transceiver technolo-\\ngies enable users to correctly receive multiple simultaneously\\ntransmitted data packets. With proper design, this capability\\n\\u2014 commonly referred to as multiple packet reception (MPR)\\n[1][2] \\u2014 can signi\\ufb01cantly enhance network performance.\\nMany fundamental ideas behind MPR already have been\\nwell researched and widely applied [3, \\u00a71]. Such examples\\ninclude code division multiple access (CDMA) and frequency\\ndivision multiple access (FDMA). But while MPR is applied\\ntherein as the basis for enabling multiple users to share a\\nchannel, for networks that employ packet-by-packet random\\nmultiple access, MPR represents a paradigm shift from the\\ntypical single-user (SU) to multiple-user (MU) models \\u2014\\nsomething that is only beginning to happen in practice. Em-\\nploying MPR in the physical (PHY) layer also expands the\\nset of parameters for the media access control (MAC) layer to\\nconsider in its scheduling process, thus underscoring the im-\\nportance for cross-layer design that strives to jointly optimize\\nthe functions of these layers [4]. Providing further insights\\nfor doing so in random multiple access communications with\\nMPR \\u2014 both in theory and in practice \\u2014 is the main goal of\\nthe present paper.\\n\\nA. Development of MPR in CSMA and 802.11 WLANs\\n\\nThe concept of random access on MPR channels was\\nintroduced by Ghez, Verd\\u00b4u and Schwartz in [1] and [2],\\nwhere they studied the performance of slotted ALOHA (S-\\nALOHA) with MPR. Since then there has been much research\\non multiple access with MPR. However, until only recently,\\nthere has been no research published on carrier sense multiple\\naccess (CSMA) with MPR.\\n\\nCSMA refers to a family of\\n\\nrandom multiple access\\nschemes wherein a station (STA) with packets to transmit\\nwill attempt to do so only when the channel is detected to\\nbe idle. It was \\ufb01rst shown by Kleinrock and Tobagi [5] that\\nthis provides signi\\ufb01cant performance improvement over S-\\nALOHA on the collision channel. CSMA have become the\\nfoundations of many networking technologies. For example,\\nCSMA and CSMA with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) are\\nemployed in the MAC layers of IEEE 802.11-based wireless\\nlocal area networks (WLAN) [6]. However, none of these\\ntechnologies have deployed MPR yet.\\n\\n\\fCHAN et al.: CARRIER SENSE MULTIPLE ACCESS COMMUNICATIONS ON MULTIPACKET RECEPTION CHANNELS: THEORY AND APPLICATIONS . . .\\n\\n267\\n\\nFig. 1. Typical realization of channel activities with the CSMA protocol based on our network model.\\n\\nThe \\ufb01rst substantial research on CSMA with MPR did not\\nappear until 2004 when we reported in [7] on conjoining the\\ntwo concepts and studied the resulting performance. Recog-\\nnizing the bene\\ufb01ts that MPR can bring to WLANs, in 2005\\nwe presented the idea in a proposal [8] to the 802.11 WLAN\\nWorking Group for a future WLAN standard that incorporates\\nMPR. Two years later, the notion of adapting a MU model in\\nWLAN began garnering more consideration from members of\\nthe Working Group (eg. [9]). In late 2008, the 802.11ac Task\\nGroup (TGac) was established to develop a WLAN standard\\nthat supports a maximum aggregate throughput of at least 1\\nGbps [10]. In order to realize the targeted data rates, TGac\\nrecognizes the need for higher data multiplexing ef\\ufb01ciency and\\nhas identi\\ufb01ed MPR techniques like OFDMA and spatial divi-\\nsion multiple access (SDMA), also known as MU multiple-\\ninput-multiple-output (MU-MIMO), as candidate technologies\\n[10]. TGac now has converged on adapting MU-MIMO as one\\nof the core technologies of the 802.11ac PHY layer [11].\\n\\nB. Main Contributions of This Paper\\n\\nThis paper is an extension of the seminal multiaccess theory\\non MPR channels set forth in [1] and [2] to embody another\\nessential MAC protocol \\u2014 CSMA. We \\ufb01nd that CSMA will\\nalways provide a higher throughput than S-ALOHA when\\nclosed-loop control is used, but this margin diminishes when\\nthe ability to resolve simultaneous transmissions is strong.\\nNonetheless, for systems that are evolving from SU to MU,\\nCSMA can furnish signi\\ufb01cantly better performance than S-\\nALOHA via more ef\\ufb01cient utilization of MPR capacity. This\\nis of practical signi\\ufb01cance because the emerging generation of\\nMPR-enabled WLANs likely will operate in this regime. We\\nillustrate the applicability of our theoretical results by showing\\nthe effective usage of channel resources for MPR and the\\nadvantages that MU-MIMO can offer to WLANs. In particular,\\nby simulating early 802.11ac speci\\ufb01cations, we show that its\\nSU-oriented MAC layer can under-utilize the capacity offered\\nby an MPR-enabled MU-oriented PHY layer.\\n\\nC. Other Related Work\\n\\nIn 2009, Zhang et al. reported in [12] their analysis of MPR\\nin WLANs, employing 802.11g as an example. While their\\nconclusions corroborate some themes in the theory we discuss\\nhere, their main results for CSMA are not shown analytically\\nbut via numerical results. And although they looked at S-\\nALOHA too,\\nits intricate relationship with CSMA is not\\nextensively investigated. Their entire focus is also only on\\none speci\\ufb01c type of MPR channel. Moreover, their discussion\\n\\nfor designing WLAN with MPR is on the limiting case when\\nnumber of users is in\\ufb01nite, which differs from ours on the\\n\\ufb01nite user case as re\\ufb02ected in practice. According to [13], their\\nresearch in [12] was conducted unbeknownst of our earlier\\nwork.\\n\\nOther researchers also have published results on this topic\\nthat enrich the theory and advance our understanding of it,\\nlike [14] and [15]. Particularly, Gau [14] provided another\\ntreatment of this topic by applying the traditionally used but\\npossibly unrealistic framework wherein the overall offered\\ntraf\\ufb01c is Poisson; we discuss in III-D how this provides an\\nalternative perspective of the theory in this paper.\\n\\nII. THE NETWORK MODEL\\n\\nA. Topology, Timing Relations and the CSMA Protocol\\n\\nWe consider a network with an unbounded number of\\nstations (STAs) contending to transmit data packets to a central\\nbase station. Such a network model corresponds to the uplink\\nof the infrastructure mode in 802.11 WLANs, wherein the\\nbase station is referred to as access point (AP) [6].\\n\\nWe assume each STA can perform carrier sensing, namely\\nto detect whether the channel is currently idle or busy (i.e., that\\nthere is at least one other STA transmitting), and we assume\\nthe time required to do so is negligible (i.e., zero detection\\ntime).1 As illustrated in Fig. 1, we employ a slotted-time\\nsystem in which transmissions may begin only at the start\\nof a slot and that every STA is synchronized to the slots.2\\nSlot duration is designated to be at least the maximum signal\\npropagation time of tprop = dmax/c seconds, where dmax is\\nthe maximum separation distance between the STAs and c is\\nthe signal\\u2019s speed of propagation through the network\\u2019s PHY\\nmedium.3 Such a setup ensures that, after a transmission stops,\\nevery STA will \\ufb01nd the channel to be clear for transmission\\nafter one slot\\u2019s time; thus, each transmission must be preceded\\nby an idle slot. We also assume packets are of constant length\\nlasting T seconds. As in [5] and [17, \\u00a74.4], without loss of\\ngenerality, we choose T = 1, which is equivalent to expressing\\ntime in units of T . We also express the slot duration in terms\\nof this normalized time unit as \\u03c4 = tprop/T , 0 < \\u03c4 < \\u221e.\\nConsequently, a packet will last for 1/\\u03c4 slots, where we have\\nassumed as in [5] that 1/\\u03c4 is an integer.4 In our model,\\n\\n1Note that in 802.11 WLANs [6] a STA has to detect that the channel has\\n\\nbecome busy within 4 \\u03bcs, which is also less than half of the slot duration.\\n\\n2We will forgo analyzing the non-slotted versions as their performances\\n\\nare inferior to those of slotted versions [16] [5].\\n\\n3Eg., c is the speed of light for the air interface in wireless networks.\\n4We can achieve this integral assumption practically by designing one\\u2019s\\n\\nslot duration to \\ufb01t this requirement.\\n\\n\\f268\\n\\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS, VOL. 61, NO. 1, JANUARY 2013\\n\\neach STA immediately becomes aware of its transmission out-\\ncomes,5 either successful or unsuccessful, without expending\\nextra cost; in this regard, acknowledgements introduce only\\n\\ufb01xed overheads and hence can be neglected from the model\\nwithout affecting comparative analyses.\\n\\nFig. 1 illustrates a typical realization of channel activities\\nwith the CSMA protocol. It is not dif\\ufb01cult to see that CSMA\\u2019s\\nchannel activities can be modelled by a renewal process.\\nNamely, the process regenerates itself after either an idle slot\\nor an idle slot followed by transmission attempts that last for\\na packet\\u2019s duration. We will refer to either of these events as\\na transmission period (TP).\\n\\nOur analysis focuses on CSMA with immediate \\ufb01rst trans-\\nmission (IFT) admission control. Under this policy, when a\\npacket arrives at an inactive STA and the channel is sensed\\nidle, then the STA will attempt to transmit the packet at the\\nstart of the slot immediately following the packet\\u2019s arrival.\\nIf the channel is sensed busy, then the STA will defer its\\nattempt until there is idleness, and thereupon decides randomly\\nwhether to \\u201cbackoff\\u201d or transmit. This random backoff is mod-\\nelled as an independent sampling from a geometric distribution\\nwith parameter p, 0 \\u2264 p \\u2264 1; in other words, each STA\\nattempts transmission with probability p or backs off with\\nprobability 1\\u2212 p.6 The process is repeated if the channel is\\nsensed busy after a backoff or that the packet transmission is\\nnot successfully received.\\n\\nNote\\n\\nthat CSMA with IFT is\\n\\nslotted\\nnon-persistent CSMA protocol introduced by Kleinrock and\\nTobagi in [5]. This variant of CSMA is, moreover, the primary\\nMAC protocol practiced in 802.11 WLANs, called distributed\\ncoordinated function (DCF) [6].\\n\\nexactly the\\n\\nB. Network Traf\\ufb01c and Throughput Characteristics\\n\\nEach STA in our in\\ufb01nite population network model can have\\nup to one packet to be transmitted at any time, be it a newly\\narrived packet or a so-called backlogged packet that needs to\\nbe retransmitted. Packet arrivals for non-backlogged STAs are\\nassumed to be independent and identically distributed from\\nslot to slot. Let \\u02c6At denote the number of new packets that\\narrived during the idle slot of TP t, t \\u2265 0. Assume \\u02c6At has\\nprobability distribution P [ \\u02c6At = n] = \\u02c6\\u03bbn, for n \\u2265 0, such that\\nthe mean arrival rate per slot is\\n\\n\\u221e(cid:2)\\n\\n\\u02c6\\u03bb =\\n\\nn\\u02c6\\u03bbn = \\u03c4 \\u03bb,\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nn=1\\n\\nwhere \\u03bb is the mean arrival rate per normalized time unit (i.e.,\\nper packet duration) and is \\ufb01nite. Described more precisely,\\nour packet arrival model is a point process over the real time\\nline, with mean measure equal to the unit rate \\u03bb scaled by the\\nLebesgue measure. Note that a homogeneous Poisson point\\nprocess of intensity \\u03bb satis\\ufb01es condition (1).\\n\\n5This assumption re\\ufb02ects 802.11 WLANs wherein the STA that has\\nsuccessfully received a data packet has to transmit an acknowledgement packet\\nimmediately after a \\ufb01xed short duration; otherwise, receipt of the data packet\\nis considered unsuccessful.\\n\\n6Note that the exponential backoff process used in 802.11 can be equiv-\\nalently modelled by such a sampling from a geometric distribution with an\\nappropriate p [18].\\n\\nWhen the arrival statistics are described in this manner, \\u03bb\\nis equivalent to the mean arrival rate considered in many well\\nknown results, such as [1] and [2] for S-ALOHA with MPR\\nor [5] and [17, \\u00a74.4] for CSMA on the collision channel. In\\nother words, our current setup facilitates direct and meaningful\\ncomparison of our results with those in classical multiple\\naccess theory. In particular, the maximum \\u03bb for which packets\\ncan be successfully transmitted by a multiaccess protocol\\non a channel with asymptotically \\ufb01nite average delay is the\\nchannel\\u2019s maximum achievable stable throughput with that\\nprotocol [17, \\u00a74.2.3].\\n\\nC. The MPR Channel Model and Examples\\n\\nWe employ the symmetric MPR channel model of [1], with\\nwhich the successful reception probabilities depend only on\\nthe number of packets transmitted in the slot. For the in\\ufb01nite\\npopulation scenario, given that n packets are transmitted, for\\n1 \\u2264 n \\u2264 \\u221e, 0 \\u2264 k \\u2264 n, let\\nCn,k = P [k packets are correctly received| n are transmitted].\\nClearly, the symmetric MPR channel model is a generalized\\nformulation and embodies as a special case the classical\\ncollision channel, which has C1,0 = 0 and Cn,0 = 1 for all\\nn > 1.\\n\\nWe denote the expected number of packets correctly re-\\n\\nceived from a transmission set of n STAs by\\n\\nCn (cid:2)\\n\\nkCn,k,\\n\\nn(cid:2)\\n\\nk=1\\n\\nC (cid:2) sup\\n\\nn\\n\\nCn,\\n\\nand assume that its limit C = limn\\u2192\\u221e Cn exists, which is\\nusually the case in practice [1]. For instance, it is natural\\nto expect C = 0 because practical PHY layers have \\ufb01nite\\nresources and hence cannot support an unbounded number of\\nsimultaneous transmissions. We de\\ufb01ne channel capacity to be\\n\\nnamely the largest expected successes with simultaneous trans-\\nmissions on a channel.\\nIn addition, we also assume that Cn is concave in n,\\na property possessed by reasonable MPR channels. To see\\nwhy, say we have n1 < n2 < arg supn Cn. Then it\\nis\\nunreasonable to expect Cn1 > Cn2 < C because, if the channel\\nis still capable of supporting more successful receptions even\\nwhen greater than n2 STAs transmit, then we should have\\nCn1 \\u2264 Cn2. Similarly, say arg supn Cn < n3 < n4, then we\\nshould have Cn3 \\u2265 Cn4, because the channel can only yield\\nfewer successes with an increasing number of transmitting\\nSTAs if there already are greater than arg supn Cn of them.\\nIt is possible for supn Cn to be achieved at more than one n,\\nbut with said assumption this must occur over one and only\\none consecutive set of n\\u2019s.\\n\\nIn sections below we discuss two speci\\ufb01c MPR channels\\nwe consider exemplary and refer the reader to [1] and [2]\\nfor additional ones. In the q-frequencies frequency-hopping\\nchannel, each STA chooses with equal probability one of q\\nfrequencies on which to transmit. If more than one STAs\\nchoose the same frequency, then their transmissions will fail.\\n\\n\\fCHAN et al.: CARRIER SENSE MULTIPLE ACCESS COMMUNICATIONS ON MULTIPACKET RECEPTION CHANNELS: THEORY AND APPLICATIONS . . .\\n\\n269\\n\\nSuch a channel has Cn = n(1 \\u2212 1/q)n\\u22121 [1]. We will have\\nan equivalent channel model if orthogonal multiuser codes\\nare used instead of the q frequencies, i.e., STAs select one\\nof q codes to encode their transmissions, failure occurring\\nwhenever two or more STAs select the same code. Another\\nexample we consider is the N -user channel, which assumes\\nfailed reception when the transmission set is strictly greater\\nthan N . The expected success of this channel is simply Cn = n\\nfor n \\u2264 N and Cn = 0 for n > N . Note that the Cn\\u2019s of both\\nchannels are concave in n.\\n\\nis how well\\n\\nA meaningful performance measure of a multiaccess pro-\\ntocol\\nit utilizes a channel\\u2019s MPR capacity;\\naccordingly we de\\ufb01ne ef\\ufb01ciency to be the protocol\\u2019s maximum\\nstable throughput divided by C.\\n\\nIII. CAPACITY OF CSMA ON MPR CHANNELS\\n\\nA. Ergodicity Region of CSMA\\n\\nThere have been many results on the stability and dynamic\\ncontrol of CSMA, but they pertain to the collision channel\\n[17, \\u00a74.4] [19] [20]. Although they used different de\\ufb01nitions\\nof stochastic stability and attacked the problem with unique\\napproaches, they all concluded that CSMA with the collision\\nchannel is inherently unstable, which is expected from its\\ntraf\\ufb01c load-throughput curve (cf. [17, \\u00a74.2] and [5]). We\\nemploy instead the analytic framework used for S-ALOHA in\\n[1] and [2]:7 A system is de\\ufb01ned to be stable if the discrete-\\ntime Markov chain {Xt}t\\u22650, whose state is the number of\\nbacklogged packets in the system at the beginning of the tth\\nTP, is ergodic and unstable otherwise [17, \\u00a73A.5].\\nWe give the state transition probabilities of {Xt} in Ap-\\npendix A. We can see from them that {Xt} will be irreducible\\nand aperiodic as long as it satis\\ufb01es the suf\\ufb01cient condition\\nthat 0 < \\u02c6\\u03bb0 < 1, which we assume holds as it is true for all\\nreasonable scenarios.\\nTo obtain our \\ufb01rst main result, we examine the expected\\ndrift of the Markov chain {Xt} at state n, n \\u2265 0, which is\\ngiven by\\n\\ndn = E[Xt+1 \\u2212 Xt|Xt = n] = E[At \\u2212 \\u03a3t|Xt = n],\\n\\nif there is at\\n\\nwhere At and \\u03a3t are respectively the no. of new packets that\\narrived and the no. of successful transmissions during TP t.\\nObserve that the expected number of arrivals during a TP\\ndepends on whether there are arrivals during its idle slot\\nand whether any of the backlogged STAs decide to transmit\\nin the slot after it. Due to IFT,\\nleast one\\narrival in the idle slot, then the TP will consist of this idle\\nslot followed by a transmission, regardless of how many\\nbacklogged STAs also decide to transmit during this time too.\\nAnd of course, this situation also occurs even if the idle slot\\nhas no packet arrivals but at least one of the n backlogged\\nSTAs transmits, which occurs with probability 1 \\u2212 (1 \\u2212 p)n.\\nSince the expected number of arrivals during a slot and during\\na packet transmission are respectively \\u03c4 \\u03bb and \\u03bb, we have\\nE[At|Xt = n] = \\u03c4 \\u03bb + (1 \\u2212 \\u02c6\\u03bb0)\\u03bb + \\u02c6\\u03bb0[1 \\u2212 (1 \\u2212 p)n]\\u03bb\\n\\n= \\u03bb[1 + \\u03c4 \\u2212 \\u02c6\\u03bb0(1 \\u2212 p)n].\\n\\n7In homage to Ghez, Verd\\u00b4u and Schwartz,\\n\\nin adapting their analytic\\nframework of [1] and [2], we have kept many of their notations unchanged\\nor as similar as possible.\\n\\nTo \\ufb01nd \\u03a3t, observe that the STAs contributing to channel\\ncontention in the current TP are only those with packets that\\narrived during the idle slot and those that are retransmissions\\nfrom STAs backlogged at the start of this TP. As in the\\nderivation in [1], let Rt be the number of transmissions from\\nbacklogged STAs in TP t. Then\\n\\nP [\\u03a3t = k|Xt = n, \\u02c6At = i, Rt = j] = Ci+j,k,\\n\\nfor i \\u2265 0, 0 \\u2264 j \\u2264 n, 0 \\u2264 k \\u2264 i + j. With the convention that\\nC0,0 = 0, we have\\n\\nE[\\u03a3t|Xt = n, \\u02c6At = i, Rt = j] = Ci+j\\n\\nand hence get\\n\\nE[\\u03a3t|Xt = n] =\\n\\nn(cid:2)\\n\\nj=0\\n\\n\\u02c6\\u03bbi\\n\\nBn(j)Ci+j ,\\n\\n\\u221e(cid:2)\\n(cid:3)\\n(cid:4)\\n\\ni=0\\n\\nwhere we have let Bn(j) =\\ndn = \\u03bb(1 + \\u03c4 ) \\u2212 \\u03bb\\u02c6\\u03bb0(1 \\u2212 p)n \\u2212\\n\\nn\\nj\\n\\npj(1 \\u2212 p)n\\u2212j. Therefore,\\n\\u221e(cid:2)\\nBn(j)Ci+j .\\n\\nn(cid:2)\\n\\n\\u02c6\\u03bbi\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nThen by applying a result from [1], we arrive at the following\\nresult on the ergodicity region of CSMA.\\n\\ni=0\\n\\nj=0\\n\\nTheorem 1. A CSMA system is stable for all arrival distri-\\n1+\\u03c4 C,\\nbutions such that \\u03bb < 1\\nwhere C = limn\\u2192\\u221e Cn. (This also holds if C is in\\ufb01nite: if\\nlimn\\u2192\\u221e Cn = +\\u221e, then the system is always stable.)\\n\\n1+\\u03c4 C and is unstable for \\u03bb > 1\\n\\nProof: From (2) we can see that \\u22122\\u03bb\\u2212 n < dn < \\u03bb(1 +\\n\\u03c4 ), so |dn| is \\ufb01nite for n < \\u221e. Then we can use Lemma 1\\nof [1], which states that\\n\\n\\u221e(cid:2)\\n\\nn(cid:2)\\n\\n\\u02c6\\u03bbi\\n\\nlim\\nn\\u2192\\u221e\\n\\ni=0\\n\\nj=0\\n\\nBn(j)Ci+j = C,\\n\\nD(i) = \\u2212 i(cid:2)\\n\\nand see that the limit of equation (2) as n goes to in\\ufb01nity is\\n\\nn\\u2192\\u221e dn = \\u03bb(1 + \\u03c4 ) \\u2212 C.\\n\\nlim\\n\\nThen our result on the stable region follows by Pakes\\u2019 Lemma\\n(Theorem 2 of [21]).\\nTo obtain our result on the unstable region, we will verify\\nthat Kaplan\\u2019s condition [22] is satis\\ufb01ed provided that Cn <\\nL, n \\u2265 1, for some L \\u2208 (0,\\u221e).

Denoting \\u03b7c,o to be CSMA\\u2019s open-loop throughput,\\n1+\\u03c4 C.\\nthen Theorem 1 states that \\u03b7c,o = 1\\nAnother implication of Theorem 1 is that, since C = 0 for\\nthe collision channel, the corresponding open-loop throughput\\nis then \\u03b7c,o = 0, which agrees with the known results\\nthat CSMA over the collision channel is inherently unstable\\nwithout resort to a control protocol.

Note that, when compared with Fig. 1, the\\nonly difference in the channel activities is that CSMA\\u2019s idle slots are shorter.\\n\\nslots\\n\\ncompare \\u03b7c,o with the open-loop throughput for S-ALOHA\\ngiven in [1], which we will denote by \\u03b7a,o.

This is because the network\\nmodel assumed in [1] hasn\\u2019t accounted for signal propagation\\ndelay. Certainly,\\nif one were to implement S-ALOHA in\\npractice, as illustrated in Fig. 2, propagation delay will destroy\\nthe synchronous assumption and detrimental interferences can\\noccur between packets. Thus, as Roberts originally proposed\\n[16], S-ALOHA\\u2019s slot size should have at least 1 + \\u03c4 time\\nunits. By applying the same derivations set forth in [1], one\\ncan extend their results to show that S-ALOHA with a slot\\n1+\\u03c4 C. This means S-ALOHA\\nsize of 1+\\u03c4 actually has \\u03b7a,o = 1\\nand CSMA perform identically with open-loop control. In\\nother words, Theorem 1 has the important implication that\\nCSMA\\u2019s extra capability to sense the channel affords no\\nadditional advantage for random multiple access when no\\ncontrol protocol is used; we\\u2019ll see below how this is different\\nwhen a control protocol is employed.\\n\\nB. Maximum Decentralized Stable Throughput of CSMA\\n\\nSimilar to the decentralized control strategies analyzed in\\n[2] and the references therein, we consider strategies in which\\nSTAs adjust their retransmission probability according to the\\nfeedback information they can obtain from the channel. These\\nschemes can be characterized in such a form:\\n\\npt = F (St)\\n\\nand St+1 = G(St, Zt),\\n\\n(4)\\n\\nwhere pt is the retransmission probability to be used in TP t,\\nSt is an estimate of the backlogged STAs Xt at the beginning\\nof TP t, and Zt is the feedback information at the end of TP\\nt.8 To proceed with the analysis, we represent this system by\\na discrete-time homogeneous Markov chain {Xt, St}t\\u22650, the\\nstate of which at time t is the pair {Xt, St}. This Markov chain\\nalso will be irreducible and aperiodic if the same suf\\ufb01cient\\ncondition previously stated for {Xt} is satis\\ufb01ed, which we\\nhenceforth assume to be the case.\\n\\nLet \\u03b7c,c be the maximum stable throughput achievable by\\nCSMA with decentralized closed-loop control. Toward \\ufb01nding\\n\\u03b7c,c, we will \\ufb01rst study the case when each STA knows\\nthe beginning of TP t and determine the optimal\\nXt at\\ncontrol function F \\u2217\\n(Xt) for it. To do that, we proceed by\\n\\n8See [2] for discussion on implementing such a closed-loop control.\\n\\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS, VOL. 61, NO. 1, JANUARY 2013\\n\\nanalyzing the Markov chain {Xt} in Section III-A but with\\np = pt = F (Xt). This will then reveal the largest ergodicity\\nregion with decentralized control (4), and thus the highest\\npossible achievable stable throughput (cf.[2]).\\nTheorem 2. There exists a retransmission probability p\\u2217\\nn that\\nminimizes the expected drift, dn.

Thus, unless the entire packet arrival\\nprobability distribution is speci\\ufb01ed, it is unclear whether there\\nexist solutions to (5) and we cannot draw more meaningful\\ngeneral conclusions from it. It turns out, however, that a\\nPoisson distribution will give a solution to (5), i.e., that the\\narrival per slot is Poisson distributed with parameter \\u03c4 \\u03bb . Since\\n\\n\\fCHAN et al.: CARRIER SENSE MULTIPLE ACCESS COMMUNICATIONS ON MULTIPACKET RECEPTION CHANNELS: THEORY AND APPLICATIONS . . .\\n\\n271\\n\\nPoisson arrivals are also a \\ufb01tting \\u2014 if not the de facto \\u2014\\nstatistical model for packet generation in networks of large\\nnumbers of STAs, we assume henceforth that the packet arrival\\nper slot has such a probability distribution.

An additional insight herein and implicit in [2] is\\nthe juncture that occurs, i.e., when closed-loop control is \\ufb01rst\\nrendered unnecessary and open-loop control alone suf\\ufb01ces, is\\nwhen the MPR channel has C = lim supn\\u22651 Cn = C (cf. [24]).\\nTo illustrate the results in our discussion thus far, we\\nplot \\u03b7c,c, \\u03b7a,c and their ef\\ufb01ciencies in Figs. 3\\u20136 for the\\nq-orthogonal-codes and N -user MPR channels. These val-\\nues and the x\\u2019s that attain them are also given in Ta-\\nbles I\\u2013II, where xc = arg supx\\u22650 \\u03a5(x,{Cn}) and xa =\\narg supx\\u22650 \\u0393(x,{Cn}).\\nObserve that the N -user channel has N = {N} at each\\nincrement in channel capacity; so, its MPR strength is be-\\ncoming stronger. The same is true for the q-orthogonal-codes\\nchannel, which has N = {n : n \\u2265 1} at each q because\\nC(q+1)\\nn , \\u2200n \\u2265 1.

This\\ntoo is expected for the q-orthogonal-codes channel, since\\nq ) \\u2192 e\\u22121/q at large q, it can be easily shown that\\n(1 \\u2212 1\\n\\n\\f274\\n\\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS, VOL. 61, NO. 1, JANUARY 2013\\n\\nC \\u2192 qe\\u22121 at large q (as con\\ufb01rmed by the normalized capacity\\nin Fig. 4); thus, its ef\\ufb01ciency evolves into \\u223c 1\\n1+\\u03c4 at large q. As\\n\\u03b7a,c/N is bounded between 1 \\u2212(cid:12)\\nfor the N -user MPR channel, said trend is due to the fact that\\n1/N\\n\\n(ln N )/N and 1 \\u2212(cid:12)\\n\\nat large N , where both increase at a slow rate.\\n\\nInterestingly, while S-ALOHA\\u2019s ef\\ufb01ciency always rises\\nfrom below, CSMA\\u2019s ef\\ufb01ciency may initially reach a local\\nmaximum \\u2014 even as high as 1 when \\u03c4 is small for some\\nchannels \\u2014 before tapering off to approach S-ALOHA\\u2019s.\\nThis perhaps unintuitive effect can be shown from (15). For\\ninstance, as long as supn\\u22651 Cn \\u2264 C1, ef\\ufb01ciency can be\\nmaintained at or increase toward 1 (cf. Fig. 4). And even after\\nsaid local maximum, CSMA\\u2019s ef\\ufb01ciency (and throughput) can\\nstill be considerably higher than S-ALOHA\\u2019s. This indicates\\nCSMA can be much more ef\\ufb01cient than S-ALOHA at utilizing\\nthe MPR capability in the region where the SU channel is just\\nbeginning to evolve into a MU one. We discuss in Section\\nIV how this region is an important one to consider because\\nresources for enabling more MPR can be scarce in practice.\\n\\nD. Connection to Results from Classical Multiaccess Theory\\n\\n1\\n\\n(cid:5)\\u221e\\nalternative\\nn=1 Cn\\n\\nxn\\nn!\\n\\nis\\ni.e.,\\n\\nthe\\n\\nis\\n\\ninterpretation\\n\\nequivalent\\nsupremum of\\n\\nthat\\nAn\\n\\u03c4 supx\\u22650 e\\u2212x\\nto\\n\\u03c4 supX\\u223cP oiss(x),x\\u22650 E[CX ],\\n1\\nthe\\nexpectation of CX over all X, where X is a Poisson\\ndistributed random variable with mean x [2]. Because\\neach TP for S-ALOHA is 1 + \\u03c4, be it idle or not, (12)\\ncan be explained by said interpretation via renewal theory\\narguments.10 This applies to CSMA too: Due to the bene\\ufb01ts of\\nchannel sensing, its difference from S-ALOHA is that an idle\\nslot lasts only \\u03c4 time units, so the TP for CSMA has expected\\nvalue of (1 + \\u03c4 )P [X > 0] + \\u03c4 P [X = 0] = 1 + \\u03c4 \\u2212 e\\u2212x,\\nwhich is re\\ufb02ected in (10).\\n\\nAnother perspective on CSMA\\u2019s diminishing throughput\\ngain also follows. As the MPR strength becomes stronger,\\nSTAs can then transmit at any slot and have a lower chance of\\ncollision; thus, there are fewer idle slots. This is con\\ufb01rmed by\\nxc and xa both increasing with MPR strength, i.e., P [X = 0]\\nis decreasing. When channel activities are viewed solely as a\\nrenewal process, the only difference between CSMA and S-\\nALOHA is that the former has shorter idle slots, and so, if idle\\nslots are becoming fewer, then the TPs for both protocols must\\nbe approaching the same duration; ergo, the same throughput.\\nFinally, note that X, the number of transmission attempts\\nin each slot, is actually the overall offered network traf\\ufb01c, i.e.,\\nthe aggregate of both new and backlogged traf\\ufb01c. That\\u2019s why\\nour \\u03b7c,c value for the collision channel is the same as that from\\nKleinrock and Tobagi [5] despite the fact that their derivation,\\nlike many multiaccess research of that era, hinges on the\\n\\ufb02awed assumption [2] [17, \\u00a74.2.2] that the network\\u2019s offered\\ntraf\\ufb01c is approximately Poisson distributed. Note that this is\\nalso true for the CSMA with MPR throughputs calculated\\nfrom Gau\\u2019s equation (5) of [14], which actually has the same\\nPoisson traf\\ufb01c assumption.\\n\\n10By renewal theory arguments, throughput (as measured in units of packets\\nper unit time) is the expected duration of successful attempts divided by\\nthe expected duration of the transmission period (i.e., renewal cycle), and\\nmultiplied by the expected number of packets in each successful attempt.\\n\\nIV. APPLYING MPR IN PRACTICE AND PERFORMANCE OF\\n\\n802.11 WLANS WITH MU-MIMO\\n\\nA. Insights for Practical Designs of MPR-enabled Networks\\nPerhaps not emphasized enough in MPR multiaccess re-\\nsearch is the unstated assumption that even as more simulta-\\nneously transmitted packets can be successfully received, the\\npacket\\u2019s data rate has to be maintained at some minimum level\\nin order to achieve actual increase in network throughput. In\\nother words, we cannot examine solely the improvement on\\nmultiaccess throughput expressed in packets per unit time; we\\nneed to also consider whether and how much the packet\\u2019s data\\nrate has been sacri\\ufb01ced by the diverting of channel resources to\\nsupport MU capability. Simply put, if we denote r1 and \\u03b71 to\\nbe the respective data rate (in bits per packet) and multiaccess\\nthroughput (in packets per unit time) for a PHY layer, and\\nr2 and \\u03b72 for those of another PHY layer with stronger MPR\\nstrength, then, even though \\u03b72 > \\u03b71, we still need\\n\\n\\u03b72/\\u03b71 > r1/r2\\n\\n(14)\\n\\nin order for the latter PHY layer to deliver a higher network\\nthroughput of \\u03b72r2, in bits per unit time.\\n\\nThe basis for MU capability is to exploit resources in the\\nchannel that provide orthogonal properties to support MPR.\\nUltimately, this is equivalent to \\ufb01nding what is known as\\ndegrees of freedom (DoF) from the channel to multiplex data\\nstreams [3, \\u00a71]. The design criteria that we describe here is:\\nA resource that gives rise to new DoF should be used to\\nincrease MU capability when (14) can be satis\\ufb01ed; otherwise,\\nthe network throughput can be made higher by applying the\\nresource to instead increase the data rate of each packet.\\n\\nB. WLAN Design Constraints and Advantages of MU-MIMO\\nMIMO signaling with multiple antennas exploits the spatial\\ndiversity \\u201cresource\\u201d in multipaths of a wireless channel to\\ngenerate DoF that can be used for boosting a point-to-point\\nlink\\u2019s spectral ef\\ufb01ciency or robustness. Because of indepen-\\ndent fading statistics among users\\u2019 propagation paths, MU\\ndiversity also exists as a resource for creating DoF to multiplex\\nMU data streams [27]. The challenge in designing MIMO\\nsystems centers on balancing the trade-offs among said various\\ngains with the available DoF.\\n\\nWhile MIMO spatial multiplexing of additional data\\nstreams increases data rates linearly, the SNR required to\\nrobustly receive them also grows noticeably. In fact, a cur-\\nrently impractical level of SNR is required to receive just a\\nfew spatial streams signaled at high orders of modulation and\\ncoding rates [28, \\u00a75.3]. Contrastingly, indoor measurements\\nshow MU-MIMO can achieve considerably higher spectral\\nef\\ufb01ciencies than SU-MIMO for the same SNR and number of\\nreceive antennas per user [29]\\u2013[30]. This implies that, as SNR\\nand number of receive antennas are typical WLAN design\\nconstraints,\\nthe extra DoF obtained from adding transmit\\nantennas should be applied on MU multiplexing rather than on\\nraising the level of a SU\\u2019s spatial multiplexing toward levels\\nthat the system cannot sustain robustly. And since a PHY layer\\nthat uses these new DoF to improve its SU data rate cannot\\npractically do so below a certain SNR, when this PHY layer is\\ncompared to another that instead diverts these DoF to increase\\n\\n\\fCHAN et al.: CARRIER SENSE MULTIPLE ACCESS COMMUNICATIONS ON MULTIPACKET RECEPTION CHANNELS: THEORY AND APPLICATIONS . . .\\n\\n275\\n\\n)\\ns\\np\\nb\\nG\\n\\n(\\n \\nt\\nu\\np\\nh\\ng\\nu\\no\\nr\\nh\\nt\\n \\nk\\nr\\no\\nw\\nt\\ne\\nn\\n \\ne\\nt\\na\\ng\\ne\\nr\\ng\\ng\\nA\\n\\n4\\n\\n3.5\\n\\n3\\n\\n2.5\\n\\n2\\n\\n1.5\\n\\n1\\n\\n0.5\\n\\n0\\n\\n \\n1\\n\\n11n A\\u2212MPDU limit\\n8 x 11n A\\u2212MPDU limit\\n1 s.s. per user\\n2 s.s. per user\\n3 s.s. per user\\n4 s.s. per user\\n\\n \\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n6\\n\\n7\\n\\n8\\n\\nNo. of MU\\u2212MIMO users (M)\\n\\ny\\nc\\nn\\ne\\ni\\nc\\ni\\nf\\nf\\nE\\n\\n1\\n\\n0.9\\n\\n0.8\\n\\n0.7\\n\\n0.6\\n\\n0.5\\n\\n0.4\\n\\n0.3\\n\\n0.2\\n\\n \\n1\\n\\n \\n\\n11n A\\u2212MPDU limit\\n8 x 11n A\\u2212MPDU limit\\n1 s.s. per user\\n2 s.s. per user\\n3 s.s. per user\\n4 s.s. per user\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n6\\n\\n7\\n\\n8\\n\\nNo. of MU\\u2212MIMO users (M)\\n\\nFig. 7.

And since this policy\\u2019s\\nparameters are originally designed for a SU PHY layer, the\\nsimulation results represent those of a SU-oriented MAC layer.\\nIn Figs. 7-8 we plot the network throughput and ef\\ufb01ciency\\nfor the described framework. Fig. 7 shows that MU-MIMO\\ncan offer signi\\ufb01cant increase in network throughput. However,\\nthese throughputs exhibit a ceiling, and hence the corre-\\nsponding ef\\ufb01ciencies in Fig. 8 also show a gradual decrease\\nwith M . To remedy this effect, we extend the maximum A-\\nMPDU size to 8 times that of the 802.11n limits. This would\\nmitigate the degradation on the ratio of preamble overhead to\\npayload duration as the packet\\u2019s data rate increases. But while\\nthis method improves performances, which are also plotted\\nin Figs. 7-8,\\nthe downward trend in ef\\ufb01ciencies persists.\\nEvidently such performances are those of a MAC layer that\\nis not optimized for its underlying PHY layers; otherwise,\\nas discussed in Section III, the throughputs will unboundedly\\nscale with MU capacity. Note that we have found the general\\ntrends displayed of the plots in Figs. 7-8 remain unchanged\\nwhen the number of clients in the network is varied.\\n\\nThese results clearly indicate that the current SU-oriented\\nMAC layer in 802.11 cannot fully utilize the PHY layer\\u2019s MU\\ncapacity. As expected from what we pointed out in Section III,\\nwhen the MU capacity increases, the number of idle slots has\\nto correspondingly decrease to achieve the optimal throughput.\\nThus, the fundamentals for 802.11ac can be enhanced with\\nan appropriate cross-layer design approach, in particular, by\\napplying the theory of CSMA with MPR that we discussed.\\n\\n\\f276\\n\\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS, VOL. 61, NO. 1, JANUARY 2013\\n\\nDETAILS OF OUR 802.11AC WLAN SIMULATION FRAMEWORK\\n\\nTABLE IV\\n\\nSimulation parameter\\n\\nValue\\n\\nRemarks\\n\\nOperating mode\\n\\nNo. of AP\\n\\nNo. of clients\\n\\nInfrastructure\\n\\nmode\\n\\n1\\n29\\n\\nNo. of simultaneous\\n\\ntransmissions\\n\\nDownlink: M\\nUplink: 1 to M\\n\\nChannel width and PHY data\\n\\nSee Table III\\n\\nrates\\n\\nPHY header duration\\n\\nNo. of LTFs in preamble\\n\\n16 \\u03bcs\\n\\nDepends on\\nno. of spatial\\nstreams, per\\n\\n[11]\\n\\nDownlink and uplink transmissions cannot concurrently coexist; i.e., when STA(s) transmit together\\nwith the AP, none of their frames are correctly received.\\nAP transmissions to the clients are called downlink [6].\\nClient transmissions to the AP are called uplink [6].\\nM is the maximum no. of simultaneous transmissions allowable by the MU-MIMO PHY layer.

In particular, present transceiver technolo-\ngies enable users to correctly receive multiple simultaneously\ntransmitted data packets. With proper design, this capability\n\u2014 commonly referred to as multiple packet reception (MPR)\n[1][2] \u2014 can signi\ufb01cantly enhance network performance.\nMany fundamental ideas behind MPR already have been\nwell researched and widely applied [3, \u00a71]. Such examples\ninclude code division multiple access (CDMA) and frequency\ndivision multiple access (FDMA). But while MPR is applied\ntherein as the basis for enabling multiple users to share a\nchannel, for networks that employ packet-by-packet random\nmultiple access, MPR represents a paradigm shift from the\ntypical single-user (SU) to multiple-user (MU) models \u2014\nsomething that is only beginning to happen in practice. Em-\nploying MPR in the physical (PHY) layer also expands the\nset of parameters for the media access control (MAC) layer to\nconsider in its scheduling process, thus underscoring the im-\nportance for cross-layer design that strives to jointly optimize\nthe functions of these layers [4]. Providing further insights\nfor doing so in random multiple access communications with\nMPR \u2014 both in theory and in practice \u2014 is the main goal of\nthe present paper.\n\nA. Development of MPR in CSMA and 802.11 WLANs\n\nThe concept of random access on MPR channels was\nintroduced by Ghez, Verd\u00b4u and Schwartz in [1] and [2],\nwhere they studied the performance of slotted ALOHA (S-\nALOHA) with MPR. Since then there has been much research\non multiple access with MPR. However, until only recently,\nthere has been no research published on carrier sense multiple\naccess (CSMA) with MPR.\n\nCSMA refers to a family of\n\nrandom multiple access\nschemes wherein a station (STA) with packets to transmit\nwill attempt to do so only when the channel is detected to\nbe idle. It was \ufb01rst shown by Kleinrock and Tobagi [5] that\nthis provides signi\ufb01cant performance improvement over S-\nALOHA on the collision channel. CSMA have become the\nfoundations of many networking technologies. For example,\nCSMA and CSMA with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) are\nemployed in the MAC layers of IEEE 802.11-based wireless\nlocal area networks (WLAN) [6]. However, none of these\ntechnologies have deployed MPR yet.\n\n\fCHAN et al.: CARRIER SENSE MULTIPLE ACCESS COMMUNICATIONS ON MULTIPACKET RECEPTION CHANNELS: THEORY AND APPLICATIONS . . .\n\n267\n\nFig. 1. Typical realization of channel activities with the CSMA protocol based on our network model.\n\nThe \ufb01rst substantial research on CSMA with MPR did not\nappear until 2004 when we reported in [7] on conjoining the\ntwo concepts and studied the resulting performance. Recog-\nnizing the bene\ufb01ts that MPR can bring to WLANs, in 2005\nwe presented the idea in a proposal [8] to the 802.11 WLAN\nWorking Group for a future WLAN standard that incorporates\nMPR. Two years later, the notion of adapting a MU model in\nWLAN began garnering more consideration from members of\nthe Working Group (eg. [9]). In late 2008, the 802.11ac Task\nGroup (TGac) was established to develop a WLAN standard\nthat supports a maximum aggregate throughput of at least 1\nGbps [10]. In order to realize the targeted data rates, TGac\nrecognizes the need for higher data multiplexing ef\ufb01ciency and\nhas identi\ufb01ed MPR techniques like OFDMA and spatial divi-\nsion multiple access (SDMA), also known as MU multiple-\ninput-multiple-output (MU-MIMO), as candidate technologies\n[10]. TGac now has converged on adapting MU-MIMO as one\nof the core technologies of the 802.11ac PHY layer [11].\n\nB. Main Contributions of This Paper\n\nThis paper is an extension of the seminal multiaccess theory\non MPR channels set forth in [1] and [2] to embody another\nessential MAC protocol \u2014 CSMA. We \ufb01nd that CSMA will\nalways provide a higher throughput than S-ALOHA when\nclosed-loop control is used, but this margin diminishes when\nthe ability to resolve simultaneous transmissions is strong.\nNonetheless, for systems that are evolving from SU to MU,\nCSMA can furnish signi\ufb01cantly better performance than S-\nALOHA via more ef\ufb01cient utilization of MPR capacity. This\nis of practical signi\ufb01cance because the emerging generation of\nMPR-enabled WLANs likely will operate in this regime. We\nillustrate the applicability of our theoretical results by showing\nthe effective usage of channel resources for MPR and the\nadvantages that MU-MIMO can offer to WLANs. In particular,\nby simulating early 802.11ac speci\ufb01cations, we show that its\nSU-oriented MAC layer can under-utilize the capacity offered\nby an MPR-enabled MU-oriented PHY layer.\n\nC. Other Related Work\n\nIn 2009, Zhang et al. reported in [12] their analysis of MPR\nin WLANs, employing 802.11g as an example. While their\nconclusions corroborate some themes in the theory we discuss\nhere, their main results for CSMA are not shown analytically\nbut via numerical results. And although they looked at S-\nALOHA too,\nits intricate relationship with CSMA is not\nextensively investigated. Their entire focus is also only on\none speci\ufb01c type of MPR channel. Moreover, their discussion\n\nfor designing WLAN with MPR is on the limiting case when\nnumber of users is in\ufb01nite, which differs from ours on the\n\ufb01nite user case as re\ufb02ected in practice. According to [13], their\nresearch in [12] was conducted unbeknownst of our earlier\nwork.\n\nOther researchers also have published results on this topic\nthat enrich the theory and advance our understanding of it,\nlike [14] and [15]. Particularly, Gau [14] provided another\ntreatment of this topic by applying the traditionally used but\npossibly unrealistic framework wherein the overall offered\ntraf\ufb01c is Poisson; we discuss in III-D how this provides an\nalternative perspective of the theory in this paper.\n\nII. THE NETWORK MODEL\n\nA. Topology, Timing Relations and the CSMA Protocol\n\nWe consider a network with an unbounded number of\nstations (STAs) contending to transmit data packets to a central\nbase station. Such a network model corresponds to the uplink\nof the infrastructure mode in 802.11 WLANs, wherein the\nbase station is referred to as access point (AP) [6].\n\nWe assume each STA can perform carrier sensing, namely\nto detect whether the channel is currently idle or busy (i.e., that\nthere is at least one other STA transmitting), and we assume\nthe time required to do so is negligible (i.e., zero detection\ntime).1 As illustrated in Fig. 1, we employ a slotted-time\nsystem in which transmissions may begin only at the start\nof a slot and that every STA is synchronized to the slots.2\nSlot duration is designated to be at least the maximum signal\npropagation time of tprop = dmax/c seconds, where dmax is\nthe maximum separation distance between the STAs and c is\nthe signal\u2019s speed of propagation through the network\u2019s PHY\nmedium.3 Such a setup ensures that, after a transmission stops,\nevery STA will \ufb01nd the channel to be clear for transmission\nafter one slot\u2019s time; thus, each transmission must be preceded\nby an idle slot. We also assume packets are of constant length\nlasting T seconds. As in [5] and [17, \u00a74.4], without loss of\ngenerality, we choose T = 1, which is equivalent to expressing\ntime in units of T . We also express the slot duration in terms\nof this normalized time unit as \u03c4 = tprop/T , 0 < \u03c4 < \u221e.\nConsequently, a packet will last for 1/\u03c4 slots, where we have\nassumed as in [5] that 1/\u03c4 is an integer.4 In our model,\n\n1Note that in 802.11 WLANs [6] a STA has to detect that the channel has\n\nbecome busy within 4 \u03bcs, which is also less than half of the slot duration.\n\n2We will forgo analyzing the non-slotted versions as their performances\n\nare inferior to those of slotted versions [16] [5].\n\n3Eg., c is the speed of light for the air interface in wireless networks.\n4We can achieve this integral assumption practically by designing one\u2019s\n\nslot duration to \ufb01t this requirement.\n\n\f268\n\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS, VOL. 61, NO. 1, JANUARY 2013\n\neach STA immediately becomes aware of its transmission out-\ncomes,5 either successful or unsuccessful, without expending\nextra cost; in this regard, acknowledgements introduce only\n\ufb01xed overheads and hence can be neglected from the model\nwithout affecting comparative analyses.\n\nFig. 1 illustrates a typical realization of channel activities\nwith the CSMA protocol. It is not dif\ufb01cult to see that CSMA\u2019s\nchannel activities can be modelled by a renewal process.\nNamely, the process regenerates itself after either an idle slot\nor an idle slot followed by transmission attempts that last for\na packet\u2019s duration. We will refer to either of these events as\na transmission period (TP).\n\nOur analysis focuses on CSMA with immediate \ufb01rst trans-\nmission (IFT) admission control. Under this policy, when a\npacket arrives at an inactive STA and the channel is sensed\nidle, then the STA will attempt to transmit the packet at the\nstart of the slot immediately following the packet\u2019s arrival.\nIf the channel is sensed busy, then the STA will defer its\nattempt until there is idleness, and thereupon decides randomly\nwhether to \u201cbackoff\u201d or transmit. This random backoff is mod-\nelled as an independent sampling from a geometric distribution\nwith parameter p, 0 \u2264 p \u2264 1; in other words, each STA\nattempts transmission with probability p or backs off with\nprobability 1\u2212 p.6 The process is repeated if the channel is\nsensed busy after a backoff or that the packet transmission is\nnot successfully received.\n\nNote\n\nthat CSMA with IFT is\n\nslotted\nnon-persistent CSMA protocol introduced by Kleinrock and\nTobagi in [5]. This variant of CSMA is, moreover, the primary\nMAC protocol practiced in 802.11 WLANs, called distributed\ncoordinated function (DCF) [6].\n\nexactly the\n\nB. Network Traf\ufb01c and Throughput Characteristics\n\nEach STA in our in\ufb01nite population network model can have\nup to one packet to be transmitted at any time, be it a newly\narrived packet or a so-called backlogged packet that needs to\nbe retransmitted. Packet arrivals for non-backlogged STAs are\nassumed to be independent and identically distributed from\nslot to slot. Let \u02c6At denote the number of new packets that\narrived during the idle slot of TP t, t \u2265 0. Assume \u02c6At has\nprobability distribution P [ \u02c6At = n] = \u02c6\u03bbn, for n \u2265 0, such that\nthe mean arrival rate per slot is\n\n\u221e(cid:2)\n\n\u02c6\u03bb =\n\nn\u02c6\u03bbn = \u03c4 \u03bb,\n\n(1)\n\nn=1\n\nwhere \u03bb is the mean arrival rate per normalized time unit (i.e.,\nper packet duration) and is \ufb01nite. Described more precisely,\nour packet arrival model is a point process over the real time\nline, with mean measure equal to the unit rate \u03bb scaled by the\nLebesgue measure. Note that a homogeneous Poisson point\nprocess of intensity \u03bb satis\ufb01es condition (1).\n\n5This assumption re\ufb02ects 802.11 WLANs wherein the STA that has\nsuccessfully received a data packet has to transmit an acknowledgement packet\nimmediately after a \ufb01xed short duration; otherwise, receipt of the data packet\nis considered unsuccessful.\n\n6Note that the exponential backoff process used in 802.11 can be equiv-\nalently modelled by such a sampling from a geometric distribution with an\nappropriate p [18].\n\nWhen the arrival statistics are described in this manner, \u03bb\nis equivalent to the mean arrival rate considered in many well\nknown results, such as [1] and [2] for S-ALOHA with MPR\nor [5] and [17, \u00a74.4] for CSMA on the collision channel. In\nother words, our current setup facilitates direct and meaningful\ncomparison of our results with those in classical multiple\naccess theory. In particular, the maximum \u03bb for which packets\ncan be successfully transmitted by a multiaccess protocol\non a channel with asymptotically \ufb01nite average delay is the\nchannel\u2019s maximum achievable stable throughput with that\nprotocol [17, \u00a74.2.3].\n\nC. The MPR Channel Model and Examples\n\nWe employ the symmetric MPR channel model of [1], with\nwhich the successful reception probabilities depend only on\nthe number of packets transmitted in the slot. For the in\ufb01nite\npopulation scenario, given that n packets are transmitted, for\n1 \u2264 n \u2264 \u221e, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n, let\nCn,k = P [k packets are correctly received| n are transmitted].\nClearly, the symmetric MPR channel model is a generalized\nformulation and embodies as a special case the classical\ncollision channel, which has C1,0 = 0 and Cn,0 = 1 for all\nn > 1.\n\nWe denote the expected number of packets correctly re-\n\nceived from a transmission set of n STAs by\n\nCn (cid:2)\n\nkCn,k,\n\nn(cid:2)\n\nk=1\n\nC (cid:2) sup\n\nn\n\nCn,\n\nand assume that its limit C = limn\u2192\u221e Cn exists, which is\nusually the case in practice [1]. For instance, it is natural\nto expect C = 0 because practical PHY layers have \ufb01nite\nresources and hence cannot support an unbounded number of\nsimultaneous transmissions. We de\ufb01ne channel capacity to be\n\nnamely the largest expected successes with simultaneous trans-\nmissions on a channel.\nIn addition, we also assume that Cn is concave in n,\na property possessed by reasonable MPR channels. To see\nwhy, say we have n1 < n2 < arg supn Cn. Then it\nis\nunreasonable to expect Cn1 > Cn2 < C because, if the channel\nis still capable of supporting more successful receptions even\nwhen greater than n2 STAs transmit, then we should have\nCn1 \u2264 Cn2. Similarly, say arg supn Cn < n3 < n4, then we\nshould have Cn3 \u2265 Cn4, because the channel can only yield\nfewer successes with an increasing number of transmitting\nSTAs if there already are greater than arg supn Cn of them.\nIt is possible for supn Cn to be achieved at more than one n,\nbut with said assumption this must occur over one and only\none consecutive set of n\u2019s.\n\nIn sections below we discuss two speci\ufb01c MPR channels\nwe consider exemplary and refer the reader to [1] and [2]\nfor additional ones. In the q-frequencies frequency-hopping\nchannel, each STA chooses with equal probability one of q\nfrequencies on which to transmit. If more than one STAs\nchoose the same frequency, then their transmissions will fail.\n\n\fCHAN et al.: CARRIER SENSE MULTIPLE ACCESS COMMUNICATIONS ON MULTIPACKET RECEPTION CHANNELS: THEORY AND APPLICATIONS . . .\n\n269\n\nSuch a channel has Cn = n(1 \u2212 1/q)n\u22121 [1]. We will have\nan equivalent channel model if orthogonal multiuser codes\nare used instead of the q frequencies, i.e., STAs select one\nof q codes to encode their transmissions, failure occurring\nwhenever two or more STAs select the same code. Another\nexample we consider is the N -user channel, which assumes\nfailed reception when the transmission set is strictly greater\nthan N . The expected success of this channel is simply Cn = n\nfor n \u2264 N and Cn = 0 for n > N . Note that the Cn\u2019s of both\nchannels are concave in n.\n\nis how well\n\nA meaningful performance measure of a multiaccess pro-\ntocol\nit utilizes a channel\u2019s MPR capacity;\naccordingly we de\ufb01ne ef\ufb01ciency to be the protocol\u2019s maximum\nstable throughput divided by C.\n\nIII. CAPACITY OF CSMA ON MPR CHANNELS\n\nA. Ergodicity Region of CSMA\n\nThere have been many results on the stability and dynamic\ncontrol of CSMA, but they pertain to the collision channel\n[17, \u00a74.4] [19] [20]. Although they used different de\ufb01nitions\nof stochastic stability and attacked the problem with unique\napproaches, they all concluded that CSMA with the collision\nchannel is inherently unstable, which is expected from its\ntraf\ufb01c load-throughput curve (cf. [17, \u00a74.2] and [5]). We\nemploy instead the analytic framework used for S-ALOHA in\n[1] and [2]:7 A system is de\ufb01ned to be stable if the discrete-\ntime Markov chain {Xt}t\u22650, whose state is the number of\nbacklogged packets in the system at the beginning of the tth\nTP, is ergodic and unstable otherwise [17, \u00a73A.5].\nWe give the state transition probabilities of {Xt} in Ap-\npendix A. We can see from them that {Xt} will be irreducible\nand aperiodic as long as it satis\ufb01es the suf\ufb01cient condition\nthat 0 < \u02c6\u03bb0 < 1, which we assume holds as it is true for all\nreasonable scenarios.\nTo obtain our \ufb01rst main result, we examine the expected\ndrift of the Markov chain {Xt} at state n, n \u2265 0, which is\ngiven by\n\ndn = E[Xt+1 \u2212 Xt|Xt = n] = E[At \u2212 \u03a3t|Xt = n],\n\nif there is at\n\nwhere At and \u03a3t are respectively the no. of new packets that\narrived and the no. of successful transmissions during TP t.\nObserve that the expected number of arrivals during a TP\ndepends on whether there are arrivals during its idle slot\nand whether any of the backlogged STAs decide to transmit\nin the slot after it. Due to IFT,\nleast one\narrival in the idle slot, then the TP will consist of this idle\nslot followed by a transmission, regardless of how many\nbacklogged STAs also decide to transmit during this time too.\nAnd of course, this situation also occurs even if the idle slot\nhas no packet arrivals but at least one of the n backlogged\nSTAs transmits, which occurs with probability 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p)n.\nSince the expected number of arrivals during a slot and during\na packet transmission are respectively \u03c4 \u03bb and \u03bb, we have\nE[At|Xt = n] = \u03c4 \u03bb + (1 \u2212 \u02c6\u03bb0)\u03bb + \u02c6\u03bb0[1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p)n]\u03bb\n\n= \u03bb[1 + \u03c4 \u2212 \u02c6\u03bb0(1 \u2212 p)n].\n\n7In homage to Ghez, Verd\u00b4u and Schwartz,\n\nin adapting their analytic\nframework of [1] and [2], we have kept many of their notations unchanged\nor as similar as possible.\n\nTo \ufb01nd \u03a3t, observe that the STAs contributing to channel\ncontention in the current TP are only those with packets that\narrived during the idle slot and those that are retransmissions\nfrom STAs backlogged at the start of this TP. As in the\nderivation in [1], let Rt be the number of transmissions from\nbacklogged STAs in TP t.

A CSMA system is stable for all arrival distri-\n1+\u03c4 C,\nbutions such that \u03bb < 1\nwhere C = limn\u2192\u221e Cn. (This also holds if C is in\ufb01nite: if\nlimn\u2192\u221e Cn = +\u221e, then the system is always stable.)\n\n1+\u03c4 C and is unstable for \u03bb > 1\n\nProof: From (2) we can see that \u22122\u03bb\u2212 n < dn < \u03bb(1 +\n\u03c4 ), so |dn| is \ufb01nite for n < \u221e. Then we can use Lemma 1\nof [1], which states that\n\n\u221e(cid:2)\n\nn(cid:2)\n\n\u02c6\u03bbi\n\nlim\nn\u2192\u221e\n\ni=0\n\nj=0\n\nBn(j)Ci+j = C,\n\nD(i) = \u2212 i(cid:2)\n\nand see that the limit of equation (2) as n goes to in\ufb01nity is\n\nn\u2192\u221e dn = \u03bb(1 + \u03c4 ) \u2212 C.\n\nlim\n\nThen our result on the stable region follows by Pakes\u2019 Lemma\n(Theorem 2 of [21]).\nTo obtain our result on the unstable region, we will verify\nthat Kaplan\u2019s condition [22] is satis\ufb01ed provided that Cn <\nL, n \u2265 1, for some L \u2208 (0,\u221e). According to [23], this is\nequivalent to showing the downward part of the drift,\n\nkPi,i\u2212k,\n\n(3)\n\nis bounded below, as shown in Appendix B.\n\nk=1\n\n1\n\nBecause the ergodicity region in Theorem 1 is achieved with\n1+\u03c4 C is the maximum\nan arbitrary transmission probability p,\nstable throughput that CSMA can achieve with open-loop\ncontrol. Denoting \u03b7c,o to be CSMA\u2019s open-loop throughput,\n1+\u03c4 C.\nthen Theorem 1 states that \u03b7c,o = 1\nAnother implication of Theorem 1 is that, since C = 0 for\nthe collision channel, the corresponding open-loop throughput\nis then \u03b7c,o = 0, which agrees with the known results\nthat CSMA over the collision channel is inherently unstable\nwithout resort to a control protocol. It is also revealing to\n\n1+\u03c4 limn\u2192\u221e Cn = 1\n\n\f270\n\nStation A\n\nStation B\n\nBoth packets\n\noverlapping here\n\nSignal\n\npropagation\n\ndelay\n\nFig. 2. Unfavorable interference can occur in S-ALOHA if signal propagation\ndelay is not properly accounted for. Thus, in practice, S-ALOHA\u2019s slot size\nhas to be at least 1 + \u03c4 time units. Note that, when compared with Fig. 1, the\nonly difference in the channel activities is that CSMA\u2019s idle slots are shorter.\n\nslots\n\ncompare \u03b7c,o with the open-loop throughput for S-ALOHA\ngiven in [1], which we will denote by \u03b7a,o. Although [1] shows\nthat stability for uncontrolled S-ALOHA is achieved as long\nas \u03bb < C, this does not mean S-ALOHA actually outperforms\nCSMA by a factor of 1 + \u03c4. This is because the network\nmodel assumed in [1] hasn\u2019t accounted for signal propagation\ndelay. Certainly,\nif one were to implement S-ALOHA in\npractice, as illustrated in Fig. 2, propagation delay will destroy\nthe synchronous assumption and detrimental interferences can\noccur between packets. Thus, as Roberts originally proposed\n[16], S-ALOHA\u2019s slot size should have at least 1 + \u03c4 time\nunits. By applying the same derivations set forth in [1], one\ncan extend their results to show that S-ALOHA with a slot\n1+\u03c4 C. This means S-ALOHA\nsize of 1+\u03c4 actually has \u03b7a,o = 1\nand CSMA perform identically with open-loop control. In\nother words, Theorem 1 has the important implication that\nCSMA\u2019s extra capability to sense the channel affords no\nadditional advantage for random multiple access when no\ncontrol protocol is used; we\u2019ll see below how this is different\nwhen a control protocol is employed.\n\nB. Maximum Decentralized Stable Throughput of CSMA\n\nSimilar to the decentralized control strategies analyzed in\n[2] and the references therein, we consider strategies in which\nSTAs adjust their retransmission probability according to the\nfeedback information they can obtain from the channel. These\nschemes can be characterized in such a form:\n\npt = F (St)\n\nand St+1 = G(St, Zt),\n\n(4)\n\nwhere pt is the retransmission probability to be used in TP t,\nSt is an estimate of the backlogged STAs Xt at the beginning\nof TP t, and Zt is the feedback information at the end of TP\nt.8 To proceed with the analysis, we represent this system by\na discrete-time homogeneous Markov chain {Xt, St}t\u22650, the\nstate of which at time t is the pair {Xt, St}. This Markov chain\nalso will be irreducible and aperiodic if the same suf\ufb01cient\ncondition previously stated for {Xt} is satis\ufb01ed, which we\nhenceforth assume to be the case.\n\nLet \u03b7c,c be the maximum stable throughput achievable by\nCSMA with decentralized closed-loop control. Toward \ufb01nding\n\u03b7c,c, we will \ufb01rst study the case when each STA knows\nthe beginning of TP t and determine the optimal\nXt at\ncontrol function F \u2217\n(Xt) for it. To do that, we proceed by\n\n8See [2] for discussion on implementing such a closed-loop control.\n\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS, VOL. 61, NO. 1, JANUARY 2013\n\nanalyzing the Markov chain {Xt} in Section III-A but with\np = pt = F (Xt). This will then reveal the largest ergodicity\nregion with decentralized control (4), and thus the highest\npossible achievable stable throughput (cf.[2]).\nTheorem 2. There exists a retransmission probability p\u2217\nn that\nminimizes the expected drift, dn. With that p\u2217\nn the CSMA\nsystem is stable for \u03bb < \u03b7c,c and unstable for \u03bb > \u03b7c,c, where\n(cid:5)(cid:6)\n\n(cid:2)\n\n(cid:3)\n\n\u221e(cid:4)\n\n\u221e(cid:4)\n\n1\n\n1 + \u03c4\n\nsup\nx\u22650\n\ne\u2212x\n\n\u02c6\u03bb0\u03bb+\n\nxn\nn!\n\nn=0\n\nj=0\n\n\u02c6\u03bbjCn+j\n\n\u03b7c,c = sup\n\n\u03bb : \u03bb <\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\nThe largest stable achievable throughput by any decentralized\ncontrol algorithm of the form (4) for CSMA is \u03b7c,c of (5).\n\ni=0\n\n\u02c6\u03bbi\n\n(cid:4)\n\n(cid:3)\n\n(cid:5)n\n\n(cid:5)\u221e\n\nProof: We can write the expected drift equation (2)\nas dn(p) = \u03bb(1 + \u03c4 ) \u2212 Yn(p), where Yn(p) = \u03bb\u02c6\u03bb0(1 \u2212\npj(1 \u2212 p)n\u2212jCi+j. Since Yn(p) is\np)n +\na polynomial on [0, 1], it attains a global maximum and there\nexists a p\u2217\nn = arg maxp\u2208[0,1]Yn(p) = arg minp\u2208[0,1] dn(p); in\nother words, there exists a retransmission probability p\u2217\nn that\nminimizes the drift dn at state n.\n\nj=0\n\nn\nj\n\nFollowing the same steps used in the proof of Theorem 1 of\n[2], we can show that Yn(x/n) converges uniformly to Y (x)\nfor x \u2265 0, where\n\n(cid:7)\n\n\u02c6\u03bbjCn+j\n\n.\n\n(6)\n\nY (x) = e\u2212x\n\n(cid:6)\n\u02c6\u03bb0\u03bb +\n\n\u221e(cid:2)\n\n\u221e(cid:2)\n\nxn\nn!\n\nn=0\n\nj=0\n\nSo it follows that\nn\u2192\u221e Yn(p\u2217\n\nlim\n\nn) = lim\n\nn\u2192\u221e sup\nx\u22650\n\nYn(x/n) = sup\nx\u22650\n\nY (x).\n\nThe stable region speci\ufb01ed by (5) follows by applying Pakes\u2019\nLemma [21, Theorem 2].\n\nTo obtain the unstable region, we can proceed as we did\nin Theorem 1 but with pt = F (Xt) substituted for p. Since\npt \u2208 [0, 1], the result obtained there holds with said pt.\nTo prove the second part of the theorem, we need to\nshow that the {Xt, St} is non-ergodic with any control when\n\u03bb > \u03b7c,c. The proof of this is essentially the same as that\nfor Theorem 2 of [2], which gives the analogous result for\nS-ALOHA. (Cf. [24] for such details.)\n\nThough \u03b7c,c of (5) is derived by assuming the STAs have\nperfect knowledge of Xt, \u03b7c,c can also be achieved with\na control with partial state information. In fact, by directly\napplying the derivation in [2, \u00a7III] to our CSMA framework\nhere, we can show the same control they described for S-\nALOHA \u2014 a control that computes the backlogged estimate\nSt from feedback information Zt, where Zt = 0 when TP t\nis empty (contains no transmission) and Zt = 1 otherwise \u2014\ncan also achieve \u03b7c,c.\nBecause Y (x) is expressed in terms of the arrival proba-\nbilities {\u02c6\u03bbn}n\u22650, the expression for \u03b7c,c given by (5) is an\nimplicit equation of \u03bb. Thus, unless the entire packet arrival\nprobability distribution is speci\ufb01ed, it is unclear whether there\nexist solutions to (5) and we cannot draw more meaningful\ngeneral conclusions from it. It turns out, however, that a\nPoisson distribution will give a solution to (5), i.e., that the\narrival per slot is Poisson distributed with parameter \u03c4 \u03bb . Since\n\n\fCHAN et al.: CARRIER SENSE MULTIPLE ACCESS COMMUNICATIONS ON MULTIPACKET RECEPTION CHANNELS: THEORY AND APPLICATIONS . . .\n\n271\n\nPoisson arrivals are also a \ufb01tting \u2014 if not the de facto \u2014\nstatistical model for packet generation in networks of large\nnumbers of STAs, we assume henceforth that the packet arrival\nper slot has such a probability distribution.

And supx\u22650 Y (x) is then attained\nwith x = 1 \u2212 \u03bb(1 + \u03c4 ), so (8) reduces to the transcendental\n.

While usage of\n(8) is probably limited to numerical solutions, an equivalent\nclosed form expression can be obtained for Poisson arrivals:\n\nTheorem 3.

The relationship between CSMA and S-ALOHA is\nfurther revealed by employing Lemma 1:\n\n1+\u03c4\n\nTheorem 4. For Poisson distributed packet arrival, as the\nchannel\u2019s MPR strength becomes stronger, the maximum sta-\nble throughput achievable by CSMA, \u03b7c,c, approaches the\nmaximum stable throughput achievable by S-ALOHA, \u03b7a,c. In\nthe limit as MPR strength becomes stronger, \u03b7c,c = \u03b7a,c and\nthe two protocols both have ef\ufb01ciency of 1.\n\nProof: If the MPR channel\u2019s expected transmission suc-\ncess {Cn} has limit C = supn\u22651 Cn, then we know from the\nproof of our Theorem 3 and Property 5 of [2], respectively,\nthat the best that CSMA and S-ALOHA can achieve are\ntheir open-loop throughputs, which are the same.

Therefore,\nalong with (13), as the MPR strength becomes stronger with\neach i, \u03b7(i)\nFinally, in the limit as MPR strength increases, we have the\nideal MPR channel that has Cn = n for all n and channel\ncapacity C = \u221e.

Note that the horizontal scale here\nis different from that of Fig. 5 in order to show the relative growth of the\nef\ufb01ciency curves.\n\nout [25]. An additional insight herein and implicit in [2] is\nthe juncture that occurs, i.e., when closed-loop control is \ufb01rst\nrendered unnecessary and open-loop control alone suf\ufb01ces, is\nwhen the MPR channel has C = lim supn\u22651 Cn = C (cf. [24]).\nTo illustrate the results in our discussion thus far, we\nplot \u03b7c,c, \u03b7a,c and their ef\ufb01ciencies in Figs. 3\u20136 for the\nq-orthogonal-codes and N -user MPR channels. These val-\nues and the x\u2019s that attain them are also given in Ta-\nbles I\u2013II, where xc = arg supx\u22650 \u03a5(x,{Cn}) and xa =\narg supx\u22650 \u0393(x,{Cn}).\nObserve that the N -user channel has N = {N} at each\nincrement in channel capacity; so, its MPR strength is be-\ncoming stronger. The same is true for the q-orthogonal-codes\nchannel, which has N = {n : n \u2265 1} at each q because\nC(q+1)\nn , \u2200n \u2265 1. But\nn\nwhile their associated throughputs are increasing with channel\n\nq+1 )n\u22121 > n(1\u2212 1\n\nq )n\u22121 = C(q)\n\n= n(1\u2212 1\n\n1\n\ncapacity, they also settle into linear growths in Figs. 3 and 5.\nActually, this is expected for the q-orthogonal-codes channel,\n1+\u03c4 qe\u22121 [2] and so its growth has a constant\nsince \u03b7a,c = 1\n1+\u03c4 e\u22121. And, an approximately linear growth for\nslope of\nthe N -user channel has been predicted by [26], wherein\nN ln N and N \u2212 \u221a\nthroughputs of random access protocols for said channel are\n\u221a\nN when N is\nN are o(N ) when N is large,\nlarge. Because\nthis channel\u2019s \u03b7a,c will eventually be growing approximately\nlinearly at a small positive slope.\n\nbounded between N \u2212 \u221a\n\n\u221a\nN ln N and\n\nThese throughputs\u2019 linear asymptotic growth trends are\nas well re\ufb02ected in Figs. 4 and 6, where the associated\nef\ufb01ciencies become nearly constant with MPR strength. This\ntoo is expected for the q-orthogonal-codes channel, since\nq ) \u2192 e\u22121/q at large q, it can be easily shown that\n(1 \u2212 1\n\n\f274\n\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS, VOL. 61, NO. 1, JANUARY 2013\n\nC \u2192 qe\u22121 at large q (as con\ufb01rmed by the normalized capacity\nin Fig. 4); thus, its ef\ufb01ciency evolves into \u223c 1\n1+\u03c4 at large q. As\n\u03b7a,c/N is bounded between 1 \u2212(cid:12)\nfor the N -user MPR channel, said trend is due to the fact that\n1/N\n\n(ln N )/N and 1 \u2212(cid:12)\n\nat large N , where both increase at a slow rate.\n\nInterestingly, while S-ALOHA\u2019s ef\ufb01ciency always rises\nfrom below, CSMA\u2019s ef\ufb01ciency may initially reach a local\nmaximum \u2014 even as high as 1 when \u03c4 is small for some\nchannels \u2014 before tapering off to approach S-ALOHA\u2019s.\nThis perhaps unintuitive effect can be shown from (15). For\ninstance, as long as supn\u22651 Cn \u2264 C1, ef\ufb01ciency can be\nmaintained at or increase toward 1 (cf. Fig. 4). And even after\nsaid local maximum, CSMA\u2019s ef\ufb01ciency (and throughput) can\nstill be considerably higher than S-ALOHA\u2019s. This indicates\nCSMA can be much more ef\ufb01cient than S-ALOHA at utilizing\nthe MPR capability in the region where the SU channel is just\nbeginning to evolve into a MU one. We discuss in Section\nIV how this region is an important one to consider because\nresources for enabling more MPR can be scarce in practice.\n\nD. Connection to Results from Classical Multiaccess Theory\n\n1\n\n(cid:5)\u221e\nalternative\nn=1 Cn\n\nxn\nn!\n\nis\ni.e.,\n\nthe\n\nis\n\ninterpretation\n\nequivalent\nsupremum of\n\nthat\nAn\n\u03c4 supx\u22650 e\u2212x\nto\n\u03c4 supX\u223cP oiss(x),x\u22650 E[CX ],\n1\nthe\nexpectation of CX over all X, where X is a Poisson\ndistributed random variable with mean x [2]. Because\neach TP for S-ALOHA is 1 + \u03c4, be it idle or not, (12)\ncan be explained by said interpretation via renewal theory\narguments.10 This applies to CSMA too: Due to the bene\ufb01ts of\nchannel sensing, its difference from S-ALOHA is that an idle\nslot lasts only \u03c4 time units, so the TP for CSMA has expected\nvalue of (1 + \u03c4 )P [X > 0] + \u03c4 P [X = 0] = 1 + \u03c4 \u2212 e\u2212x,\nwhich is re\ufb02ected in (10).\n\nAnother perspective on CSMA\u2019s diminishing throughput\ngain also follows. As the MPR strength becomes stronger,\nSTAs can then transmit at any slot and have a lower chance of\ncollision; thus, there are fewer idle slots. This is con\ufb01rmed by\nxc and xa both increasing with MPR strength, i.e., P [X = 0]\nis decreasing. When channel activities are viewed solely as a\nrenewal process, the only difference between CSMA and S-\nALOHA is that the former has shorter idle slots, and so, if idle\nslots are becoming fewer, then the TPs for both protocols must\nbe approaching the same duration; ergo, the same throughput.\nFinally, note that X, the number of transmission attempts\nin each slot, is actually the overall offered network traf\ufb01c, i.e.,\nthe aggregate of both new and backlogged traf\ufb01c. That\u2019s why\nour \u03b7c,c value for the collision channel is the same as that from\nKleinrock and Tobagi [5] despite the fact that their derivation,\nlike many multiaccess research of that era, hinges on the\n\ufb02awed assumption [2] [17, \u00a74.2.2] that the network\u2019s offered\ntraf\ufb01c is approximately Poisson distributed. Note that this is\nalso true for the CSMA with MPR throughputs calculated\nfrom Gau\u2019s equation (5) of [14], which actually has the same\nPoisson traf\ufb01c assumption.\n\n10By renewal theory arguments, throughput (as measured in units of packets\nper unit time) is the expected duration of successful attempts divided by\nthe expected duration of the transmission period (i.e., renewal cycle), and\nmultiplied by the expected number of packets in each successful attempt.\n\nIV. APPLYING MPR IN PRACTICE AND PERFORMANCE OF\n\n802.11 WLANS WITH MU-MIMO\n\nA. Insights for Practical Designs of MPR-enabled Networks\nPerhaps not emphasized enough in MPR multiaccess re-\nsearch is the unstated assumption that even as more simulta-\nneously transmitted packets can be successfully received, the\npacket\u2019s data rate has to be maintained at some minimum level\nin order to achieve actual increase in network throughput. In\nother words, we cannot examine solely the improvement on\nmultiaccess throughput expressed in packets per unit time; we\nneed to also consider whether and how much the packet\u2019s data\nrate has been sacri\ufb01ced by the diverting of channel resources to\nsupport MU capability. Simply put, if we denote r1 and \u03b71 to\nbe the respective data rate (in bits per packet) and multiaccess\nthroughput (in packets per unit time) for a PHY layer, and\nr2 and \u03b72 for those of another PHY layer with stronger MPR\nstrength, then, even though \u03b72 > \u03b71, we still need\n\n\u03b72/\u03b71 > r1/r2\n\n(14)\n\nin order for the latter PHY layer to deliver a higher network\nthroughput of \u03b72r2, in bits per unit time.\n\nThe basis for MU capability is to exploit resources in the\nchannel that provide orthogonal properties to support MPR.\nUltimately, this is equivalent to \ufb01nding what is known as\ndegrees of freedom (DoF) from the channel to multiplex data\nstreams [3, \u00a71]. The design criteria that we describe here is:\nA resource that gives rise to new DoF should be used to\nincrease MU capability when (14) can be satis\ufb01ed; otherwise,\nthe network throughput can be made higher by applying the\nresource to instead increase the data rate of each packet.\n\nB. WLAN Design Constraints and Advantages of MU-MIMO\nMIMO signaling with multiple antennas exploits the spatial\ndiversity \u201cresource\u201d in multipaths of a wireless channel to\ngenerate DoF that can be used for boosting a point-to-point\nlink\u2019s spectral ef\ufb01ciency or robustness. Because of indepen-\ndent fading statistics among users\u2019 propagation paths, MU\ndiversity also exists as a resource for creating DoF to multiplex\nMU data streams [27]. The challenge in designing MIMO\nsystems centers on balancing the trade-offs among said various\ngains with the available DoF.\n\nWhile MIMO spatial multiplexing of additional data\nstreams increases data rates linearly, the SNR required to\nrobustly receive them also grows noticeably. In fact, a cur-\nrently impractical level of SNR is required to receive just a\nfew spatial streams signaled at high orders of modulation and\ncoding rates [28, \u00a75.3]. Contrastingly, indoor measurements\nshow MU-MIMO can achieve considerably higher spectral\nef\ufb01ciencies than SU-MIMO for the same SNR and number of\nreceive antennas per user [29]\u2013[30]. This implies that, as SNR\nand number of receive antennas are typical WLAN design\nconstraints,\nthe extra DoF obtained from adding transmit\nantennas should be applied on MU multiplexing rather than on\nraising the level of a SU\u2019s spatial multiplexing toward levels\nthat the system cannot sustain robustly.

Thus, MU diversity can be an effective resource\nfor realizing throughput gains from MPR in current WLANs.\nLastly, we note that \ufb01nding new channel resources to\nenhance MPR can become progressively dif\ufb01cult because of\npractical issues. For instance, the number of antennas is a\npotential constraint due to space limitations and costs. Also,\nthe maximum transmit power allowable by regulatory rules is a\nconstraint on the power density per spatial stream, limiting the\nachievable level of MU multiplexing. Consequently, although\nthe throughput gain with the next generation of WLANs\npromises to be rewarding, the increment in MPR capacity will\nonly be moderate, not dramatic.\n\nC. Performance Results and Enhancements for MU-based\n802.11ac WLANs\n\nTo see the bene\ufb01ts from applying MPR to CSMA wireless\nnetworks in practice, we have simulated the performance of\nWLANs based on the initial draft text (version D0.1) [11] pro-\nposed for the 802.11ac standard.11 While this standardization\n\n11The particular parameters we took from D0.1 have not been changed in\nD4.0, the latest and nearly \ufb01nal draft version at this paper\u2019s press time (Nov.\n2012).\n\nFig. 8.\nEf\ufb01ciency of the proposed 802.11ac WLAN in the infrastructure\nmode. The decrease in ef\ufb01ciency with M indicates the current 802.11 SU-\noriented MAC cannot fully utilize the PHY layer\u2019s MU capacity.\n\neffort is still ongoing and industry dynamics are dif\ufb01cult to\npredict, our results provide the best means for speculating at\npresent about how the \ufb01nalized speci\ufb01cation may perform.\n\nThe plan for 802.11ac to perform MU-MIMO is to extend\nthe SU-MIMO framework of 802.11n. As a result, the funda-\nmental components in the 802.11n PHY layer are adopted.\nTable III lists the 80-MHz data rates from [11] that we\nsimulated. Details of our simulation framework are explained\nin Table IV. Of note is that 802.11ac has adapted the same\nMAC backoff policy as 802.11n. And since this policy\u2019s\nparameters are originally designed for a SU PHY layer, the\nsimulation results represent those of a SU-oriented MAC layer.\nIn Figs. 7-8 we plot the network throughput and ef\ufb01ciency\nfor the described framework. Fig. 7 shows that MU-MIMO\ncan offer signi\ufb01cant increase in network throughput. However,\nthese throughputs exhibit a ceiling, and hence the corre-\nsponding ef\ufb01ciencies in Fig. 8 also show a gradual decrease\nwith M . To remedy this effect, we extend the maximum A-\nMPDU size to 8 times that of the 802.11n limits. This would\nmitigate the degradation on the ratio of preamble overhead to\npayload duration as the packet\u2019s data rate increases. But while\nthis method improves performances, which are also plotted\nin Figs. 7-8,\nthe downward trend in ef\ufb01ciencies persists.\nEvidently such performances are those of a MAC layer that\nis not optimized for its underlying PHY layers; otherwise,\nas discussed in Section III, the throughputs will unboundedly\nscale with MU capacity. Note that we have found the general\ntrends displayed of the plots in Figs. 7-8 remain unchanged\nwhen the number of clients in the network is varied.\n\nThese results clearly indicate that the current SU-oriented\nMAC layer in 802.11 cannot fully utilize the PHY layer\u2019s MU\ncapacity. As expected from what we pointed out in Section III,\nwhen the MU capacity increases, the number of idle slots has\nto correspondingly decrease to achieve the optimal throughput.\nThus, the fundamentals for 802.11ac can be enhanced with\nan appropriate cross-layer design approach, in particular, by\napplying the theory of CSMA with MPR that we discussed.\n\n\f276\n\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS, VOL. 61, NO. 1, JANUARY 2013\n\nDETAILS OF OUR 802.11AC WLAN SIMULATION FRAMEWORK\n\nTABLE IV\n\nSimulation parameter\n\nValue\n\nRemarks\n\nOperating mode\n\nNo. of AP\n\nNo. of clients\n\nInfrastructure\n\nmode\n\n1\n29\n\nNo. of simultaneous\n\ntransmissions\n\nDownlink: M\nUplink: 1 to M\n\nChannel width and PHY data\n\nSee Table III\n\nrates\n\nPHY header duration\n\nNo. of LTFs in preamble\n\n16 \u03bcs\n\nDepends on\nno. of spatial\nstreams, per\n\n[11]\n\nDownlink and uplink transmissions cannot concurrently coexist; i.e., when STA(s) transmit together\nwith the AP, none of their frames are correctly received.\nAP transmissions to the clients are called downlink [6].\nClient transmissions to the AP are called uplink [6].\nM is the maximum no. of simultaneous transmissions allowable by the MU-MIMO PHY layer. Note\nthat, unlike in our simulations, TGac has ultimately decided to de\ufb01ne only downlink MU-MIMO in\nthe current 802.11ac standard, despite early proposals to also adapt uplink MU-MIMO and leaving\nthis for potential consideration in future amendments.\nOnly those signaled by 64-QAM at rate 5/6 are used here.
