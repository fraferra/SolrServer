However, SAC solders are more brittle\nin nature due to stiffness and excessive intermetallic compounds\ngrowth at\nto pad interface. This leads to\nhigher risk of solder joints failures. Memory module-type smaller\nlead-free ball grid array (BGA) packages are constantly under\ndynamic stresses during handling and thermal stresses during\noperations. It is important to understand the dynamic perfor-\nmance and long-term reliability of memory module lead-free\nBGAs. It is believed that the printed circuit board (PCB) design\nvariations cause dynamic and long-term failure discrepancies in\nthe \ufb01elds. In this paper, different pad and trace designs are intro-\nduced to evaluate the effects of PCB design variations on the bend\nand accelerated thermal cycling (ATC) performance of lead-free\nsolder joints. Pad designs with nonsolder mask de\ufb01ned, solder\nmask de\ufb01ned (SMD), and a unique web design are assembled\nand tested. Different solder alloys, including SAC305, Sn-1.0Ag-\n0.5Cu (SAC105) SAC105, and SnPb solders, have been evaluated\nin this paper. Different PCB materials have also been evaluated\nin the test. Four-point monotonic bend tests are performed to\ncharacterize the bending performance variations with different\nPCB designs and compared with conventional Sn-Pb solder. The\nSMD pad is shown to have the best bend performance among\nall other types of designs in this paper. In addition, this design\nalso shows improvement in mitigation of PCB pad cratering with\nlead-free solders. Wide trace width seems to degrade the strength\nand is not preferred. Just as it shows superior shock resistance\nwhen compared with SAC305, the SAC105 solder alloy also shows\nbetter bend performance. There is no signi\ufb01cant improvement in\nbend performance with web design. After aging treatment, bend\nperformance of both SAC305 and SAC105 degraded by up to\n34% and 29%, respectively. However, the bend performance of\neutectic SnPb is actually improved after aging. ATC tests are\nperformed to investigate the effects of design variations on the\nlong-term reliability of lead-free solder joints; SMD design shows\nless reliability life than others. The implications of these results\nfor the reliability of lead-free solder joints are discussed in this\npaper.\n\nIndex Terms\u2014 Accelerated thermal cycling (ATC), ball grid\n\narray (BGA), lead-free, pad design, reliability, solder.\n\nI.

Typical pad cratering failure mode.\n\nout aging [1], [2]. As a result of the stiffness,\nit may\ninduce defects, particularly under dynamic loading conditions.\nDynamic performance of electronics under bend and shock\nconditions (mechanical loading) has been an important factor\nin electronics quality and reliability. The monotonic bend test\nrepresents a measure of the fracture resistance to \ufb02exural\nloading during operation, shipping, or handling of the elec-\ntronics. This method has been standardized to characterize the\nmechanical strength of the solder assembly, and can be used\nas a way to investigate the relative mechanical strength of the\nassembly. In this paper, the effects of printed circuit board\n(PCB) design variations, such as pad design and trace width,\nusing lead-free solders are studied using the monotonic bend\ntest method.\n\nOne of the typical failure modes associated with lead-free\nsolders is pad cratering. It is reported that PCB pad cratering\nfailures due to the stiffness of solder joints are more severe\nin lead-free solder joints [3]\u2013[7]. As shown in Fig. 1, a pad\ncratering failure mode for lead-free ball grid array (BGA)\npackages, it is de\ufb01ned as the crack between copper pad on\nPCB and the PCB laminate due to excess stress. Godbole et al.\nbelieved that because the pad cratering failure modes are\nstrain rate dependent, higher strain rate will induce higher\npad cratering failure [5]. Agrawal et al. also found that pad\ncratering failure mode is the dominant failure mode after drop\ntests of lead-free products, and concluded that the drop life is\ndependent on the input energy [6]. There are recent studies\nexploring quantitative approaches to evaluate pad cratering\nfailure mode. Ahmad et al. proposed a new method to test\npad cratering failures, and found that pad size, PCB materials,\npad geometry, and other factors are important factors of pad\ncratering issues [7]. One of the potential ways to mitigate\nthis type of failure mode is to use different pad design.\n\n2156\u20133950/$31.00 \u00a9 2012 IEEE\n\n\f72\n\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPONENTS, PACKAGING AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY, VOL. 3, NO. 1, JANUARY 2013\n\nThus, it is critical to understand the level of strength among\nvarious pad designs. Xie et al. also proposed using ball shear\ntests and \ufb01nite element analysis to quantify the pad adhesion\nstrength and its effects on pad cratering failures; however, it\nis dif\ufb01cult to characterize the impact of shear on the pad life\nand interfacial failures [9].\n\nThere are several reports on pad design effects on the\nreliability performance of lead-free solder joints. Chen et al.\nshowed that solder mask size affects the monotonic bend\nperformance [10]; they found that for FCBGA component after\nthe cyclic bend performance with larger solder mask opens\nshow three times better bend performance than small pad size;\nhowever, the authors did not clarify the solder mask type.\nLim et al. observed that the failure mechanism and failure\nmode are different between the solder mask de\ufb01ned (SMD)\nand nonsolder mask de\ufb01ned (NSMD) design in BGA solder\nball shear test, with solder ball crack in SMD design, and\nlaminate cratering in NSMD design [11]. Using both\nmicrostructure\nelement modeling,\nChen et al. also found that solder fatigue life signi\ufb01cantly\ndegraded with SMD design on the PCB side [12]. Similarly,\nYoshida et al. found that\nthe fatigue life of chip scale\npackages degraded signi\ufb01cantly with SMD pad design\nfrom NSMD design [13]. However, there is a lack of data\nwith comprehensive approach to study both the dynamic\nperformance and the long-term thermal cycling performance,\nby studying the variances of board design effects. Due to the\ndifference in failure mode and failure mechanism between\ndynamic performance and long-term reliability, the effects\nof board design factors on the failure mode and failure\nmechanism also need to be explored.\n\nand \ufb01nite\n\nanalysis\n\nIn this paper, different PCB design variations were\nproposed in understanding the mechanical strength of the\nlead-free assembly under monotonic bend. The pad designs\nwith SMD and NSMD con\ufb01guration, different pad sizes,\ntrace width, solder alloys, and package types were tested and\nanalyzed in this paper. Both monotonic bend and accelerated\nthermal cycling (ATC) tests were performed and analyzed in\nthis paper. Recent studies also show that aging signi\ufb01cantly\ndegraded the tensile properties of lead-free solders [1], [2].\nIt\nis also known that signi\ufb01cant degradation of dynamic\nperformance of lead-free solder joints occurs after aging\nin large-size package assembly under shock tests [3], [4].\nIn order to compare the level of improvement on lead-free\nassembly strength under the monotonic bend test, aging\ntreatment is also applied in this paper.\n\nII. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE\n\nTwo types of daisy-chained packages were studied: a chip\narea BGA (CABGA) package with 160 I/O and a \ufb01ne pitch\nBGA (FBGA) package with 60 I/O. The pitch sizes were\n0.8 mm for both type of packages, and the body size was\n12 \u00d7 12 mm for CABGA and 8 \u00d7 12 mm for FBGA. Three\ntypes of solder alloys were used in the CABGA package; they\nare Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu (SAC305), Sn-1.0Ag-0.5Cu (SAC105),\nand eutectic SnPb. Only SAC305 solder alloy was used\nfor the FBGA package.

The pad size indicated in\nTable I for SMD is the SMD opening size, which is the same\nas the NSMD copper opening. The actual copper pad under\nthe solder mask is indeed larger than 0.35 mm. There are three\ndifferent pad designs for CABGA package; they are NSMD,\nSMD, and NSMD with web design. Fig. 3 shows the pad\ndesign variations for both packages.\n\nA set of assembled test boards was preconditioned (thermal\naging) at 100 \u00b0C for 1000 h before bend test. Monotonic bend\ntest was performed based on inter-process communication\n(IPC) 9702 spec [8], and was performed at 6000 \u00b5strain/sec\n(Fig. 4). All\ntest boards were continuously electrically\nmonitored in situ during bend test\nto detect failures. An\nincrease of 20% or more of initial resistance value dur-\ning test\nis considered to be a failure. Fig. 4 shows the\nbend test setup. Strain gauges were attached to the test\nboards for in situ recording of strain value at pre-de\ufb01ned\nlocations. As shown in Fig. 5,\nthe\ncross point of the resistance increase is recorded as fail-\nure strains. Fifteen samples of each condition were tested.\nTested boards were analyzed by dye-and-pry to observe fail-\nure mode.

Aging effects of bend performance of CABGA packages.\n\nindicate that SMD pad design has the highest strain-to-failure\nvalue than that of NSMD and web design boards. It\nis\nbelieved that SMD pad design with larger copper footprint\nand the coverage of solder mask increases the resilience of\npad to PCB adhesion strength. The results also show that\nthe web design did not improve the bend performance of\nCABGA packages. Fig. 7 summarized all the bend results\nof CABGA with SAC305, SAC105, and SnPb. SAC105 pos-\nsesses the highest bend performance with 52% higher strain\nvalue than that of SAC305, SMD design for SAC105 also has\nthe best bend performance. SAC105 has lower strength than\n\nthat of SAC305 (Fig. 8); however, SAC105 is more resilient\nand shows improvement in bend performance compared to\nSAC305.\n\nFig. 9 summarizes the bend test failure strain results for\nFBGA packages, with two different PCB materials. PCB1 is\nphenolic and PCB2 is nonphenolic. The results indicate that\nPCB design with wider trace (0.25 mm or 9.8 mil) has the\nworst bend performance with the lowest bend strain value\namong all designs. The web design moderately improves the\nbend strain value. It is also indicated that the bend strain value\nis comparable for both PCB materials, indicating no signi\ufb01cant\ndifference in bend failure.

Unlike\nthe CABGA packages, the bend results of SMD design do not\nshow signi\ufb01cant improvement over NSMD design. This causes\nthe failure mode to shift to package side (NSMD design on\nthe package side) instead of PCB pad cratering.\n\nFig. 10 shows the bend test results from samples after\naging treatment. The bend performance for both SAC305 and\nSAC105 degraded signi\ufb01cantly by 34% and 29%, respectively.\nThe results are similar to the results on shock performance\nof lead-free solder joints after aging, which degraded shock\nperformance up to 37% [3]. Unlike lead-free solders, after\naging, the bend performance of eutectic SnPb solder joints\n\nis higher. It is believed that the softening of Sn/Pb solder\nafter aging contributes to the changes. Unlike lead-free solder,\neutectic SnPb solder possesses uniform two-phase structure.\nThe solder joints tend to be more resilient without losing\nstrength after aging. However, for lead-free solder, the solder\njoints become brittle due to the coarsening of second phase\nintermetallics, and that leads to lower bend performance.\n\nB.

Failure modes of SMD and NSMD.\n\nThe ATC test data of SMD, NSMD, and NSMD web design\nboards are shown in Fig. 11, the data indicate that test boards\nwith NSMD are 2\u00d7 better than that of SMD designed boards.\nNSMD web designed boards appear to have the best ATC\nperformance over SMD and NSMD. Contrary to the dynamic\nperformance of the board indicated in the previous section,\nthat SMD designed boards show the best bend performance\nover other designs. Thus, both the results of bend test and ATC\ntest will give critical guidance for product designs in terms of\npad design based on the end use condition of the products.\nFor example, products with SMD pad design may experience\nmore dynamic strength, such as drop (mechanical shock) and\nbend; SMD design can also be used at the corners of large\npackages to avoid pad cratering failures. However, for products\nexpecting longer operational life, NSMD pad is preferred.\n\nThe effects of solder alloys were also evaluated in this paper.\nAs shown in Fig. 12, the ATC performance of SAC305 lead-\nfree solders is superior to that of eutectic Sn/Pb. However, the\ndata also indicate that lead-free solder joints failure is more\nscattered than that of SnPb. This may be an indication of the\nsigni\ufb01cant aging effects on lead-free solder during the ATC\ntest. Several previous studies also found that aging effects are\nmore signi\ufb01cant on SnAgCu lead-free solders than on eutectic\nSn/Pb solders [1], [2].\n\nIV. FAILURE ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION\n\nFailure analysis, including dye-and-pry and cross-section\nanalysis was performed on the tested boards in order to\ninvestigate the failure modes and to understand the effects of\n\nPCB design variations and impact of aging on the performance\nof lead-free solder joints.\n\nFig. 13 shows the typical dye-and-pry failure map of an as-\nassembled board of CABGA packages. The CABGA devices\nhave massive dye penetration in the PCB laminate with pad\npullout or pad cratering. This is the only failure mode that\nshows evidence of dye penetration for the CABGA packages.\nIt also indicates that failures are mainly concentrated at the\ncorner locations.\n\nThe FBGA packages also have substantial dye penetration,\nbut in this case the dye can be found at both the PCB laminate\nand package laminate (Fig. 14). It indicates that the cratering\nfailure happened on both PCB side and package side. However,\nfor the PCB with SMD design, dye penetration is only found\non the package side, which indicates the failure mode for SMD\ndesign is pad pulloff on package side only (Fig. 15).\n\nSEM cross-sectional\n\nimages of the bend tested boards\ncon\ufb01rm the dye-pry results, as shown in Fig. 16. Regardless of\nthe pad design variations, the failure modes are pad cratering\non PCB side. Although, the extent of pad cratering failures\nis more severe for NSMD and web design than that of SMD\ndesign, as mentioned earlier, the SMD design shows more\nresilience to bend damage, and the failure still happens at the\nPCB side.\n\nFig. 17 shows the SEM images of the failure mode of FBGA\npackages, con\ufb01rms with the dye-pry results, it was mixed\nfailure modes for NSMD, wide trace, and web design with\nboth pad cratering on PCB side and package side. For SMD\ndesign, there is no sign of pad cratering from PCB side, the\ndominant failure mode is package side pad pulloff.

SAC105 solder showed superior shock resistance\nas well as bend performance when compared to SAC305.\nAfter aging treatment, the bend performance of both SAC305\nand SAC105 degraded by up to 34% and 29%, respectively.\nHowever, the bend performance of eutectic SnPb improved\nafter aging.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] H.

Failure analyses of solder joints after ATC test.\n\nindicates that SMD design shows improvement of mitigation\nPCB pad cratering. When the FBGA package side has NSMD\ndesign, the failure mode after bend is solely package side pad\ncratering.\n\nRegarding the difference between phenolic and nonphenolic\nPCB materials, even though it is observed that the bend strain\nvalue does not show signi\ufb01cant differences between phenolic\nand nonphenolic (Fig. 9), the bend strain does not capture PCB\nfailures due to the fact that the daisy-chain circuits are on the\nsurface layer. Severe delamination was observed during the\ntest, as shown in Fig. 18, nonphenolic PCB materials show\nmuch worse resilience to bend tests, since there is severe\ncracking in the PCB. Apparently, phenolic PCB material seems\nto be better than the nonphenolic material from this set of test\nvehicles.\n\nFailure analysis was also performed for test boards after\nATC tests. The failure mechanism was found to be different\nfrom the dynamic failures after ATC. As shown in Fig. 19, the\ndye-and-pry results show that the major failure mode is solder\njoints fatigue. It also indicates that the failure modes NSMD\nde\ufb01ned are a mixture of solder joint fracture at package side\nor PCB side. However, the failure mode for SMD designed\nboards was all at the PCB side. Fig. 20 also shows the typical\nSEM cross section of failures for both NSMD and SMD pads.\nSMD designed boards are more prone to fail at the PCB side,\nsince cracks during creep are easier to initiate and propagate\nat solder mask locations.\n\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nThe effects of the PCB design variations on the monotonic\nbend test and ATC performance were presented in this paper.\nSMD pad is shown to have the best bend performance among\nall other types of designs in this paper. In addition, this design\nalso showed improvement in mitigation of PCB pad cratering\nwith lead-free solders. However, NSMD showed two times\nbetter ATC performance than SMD design, so it is important to\nevaluate products\u2019 end-use conditions while determining what\ntype of pad is needed. SMD was preferred when products are\nprone to be subjected to dynamic loadings, such as bending\nand shock. On the other hand, NSMD was preferred when\nlonger product operation life is needed.\n\nWide trace width design seems to degrade the bend strength\nand is not preferred. There is no signi\ufb01cant improvement of\nbend performance with web design; however, it showed supe-\nrior ATC performance. Nonphenolic PCB material showed\nsigni\ufb01cant delamination during bend test. It seems that it is not\n\n\f78\n\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPONENTS, PACKAGING AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY, VOL. 3, NO. 1, JANUARY 2013\n\nTae-Kyu Lee received the Ph.D. degree in materials\nscience and engineering from the University of Cal-\nifornia, Berkeley, on studies related to high temper-\nature superconducters and nondestructive evaluation\nin 2004, and the M.S. degree in metallurgical Eengi-\nneering from Inha University, Incheon, Korea.\n\nHe was a Post-Doctoral Fellow with the Lawrence\nBerkeley National Laboratory before joining the\nCisco Component Quality and Technology Group\nin 2006.
