However, this gain diminishes as the physical layer's MPR strength increases, thereby diminishing the need for channel sensing. Nonetheless, for systems evolving from a single-user (SU) to a multiple-user (MU) channel, CSMA can furnish significantly more efficient utilization of MPR capacity than S-ALOHA. This is meaningful in practice because the emerging generation of the widely deployed IEEE 802.11 wireless local area networks (WLAN) - 802.11ac - is adapting MPR and will operate in said region. In that regard, we also discuss the effective usage of a channel's resources for MPR and highlight the advantages multiuser-MIMO (MU-MIMO), an MPR technique, can offer to WLANs.

However, SAC solders are more brittle in nature due to stiffness and excessive intermetallic compounds growth at the solder joint to pad interface. This leads to higher risk of solder joints failures. Memory module-type smaller lead-free ball grid array (BGA) packages are constantly under dynamic stresses during handling and thermal stresses during operations. It is important to understand the dynamic performance and long-term reliability of memory module lead-free BGAs. It is believed that the printed circuit board (PCB) design variations cause dynamic and long-term failure discrepancies in the fields. In this paper, different pad and trace designs are introduced to evaluate the effects of PCB design variations on the bend and accelerated thermal cycling (ATC) performance of lead-free solder joints. Pad designs with nonsolder mask defined, solder mask defined (SMD), and a unique web design are assembled and tested. Different solder alloys, including SAC305, Sn-1.0Ag-0.5Cu (SAC105) SAC105, and SnPb solders, have been evaluated in this paper. Different PCB materials have also been evaluated in the test. Four-point monotonic bend tests are performed to characterize the bending performance variations with different PCB designs and compared with conventional Sn-Pb solder. The SMD pad is shown to have the best bend performance among all other types of designs in this paper. In addition, this design also shows improvement in mitigation of PCB pad cratering with lead-free solders. Wide trace width seems to degrade the strength and is not preferred. Just as it shows superior shock resistance when compared with SAC305, the SAC105 solder alloy also shows better bend performance. There is no significant improvement in bend performance with web design. After aging treatment, bend performance of both SAC305 and SAC105 degraded by up to 34% and 29%,- respectively. However, the bend performance of eutectic SnPb is actually improved after aging. ATC tests are performed to investigate the effects of design variations on the long-term reliability of lead-free solder joints; SMD design shows less reliability life than others.

However, existing QoS-driven service composition research does not consider reconfigurable services. Moreover, the decision space may be enormous when reconfigurable services are considered. In this paper, we deal with the issues of reconfigurable service modeling and efficient service composition decision making.

The first one is based on a distributed hash table (DHT), by which a fully decentralized, key-based caching and checking system is constructed to catch cloned nodes effectively. The protocol performance on efficient storage consumption and high security level is theoretically deducted through a probability model, and the resulting equations, with necessary adjustments for real application, are supported by the simulations. Although the DHT-based protocol incurs similar communication cost as previous approaches, it may be considered a little high for some scenarios. To address this concern, our second distributed detection protocol, named randomly directed exploration, presents good communication performance for dense sensor networks, by a probabilistic directed forwarding technique along with random initial direction and border determination.

Hardware designers need to know upfront, what tradeoffs they need to make, to design an optimal system level solution. Quantitative estimates on the optimal package materials, assembly processes and design rules are required upfront as opposed to much later in the design process: In the past, several iterations of learning cycle test vehicles and modeling were used to address some of these questions, but with design cycles shrinking to less than a year in some cases, there is no time for repeated learning cycles and qualitative numerical models that only give general trends. Consequently, the industry needs a methodology that can give optimal Chip Package System Interaction (CPSI) design parameter ranges and reduce the number of prototype iterations. A key requirement in CPSI is the ability to accurately scale from chip level interconnects (on the order of a few microns), to system level features (on the order of several millimeters). Historically, CPSI has been evaluated using conventional finite element models in which smeared or submodeling techniques were used to approximate the mechanics of the assembly. Such approximations were necessary to achieve manageable computation times. However, these approximations have relegated the numerical models to qualitative trend assessments as opposed to a more regimented quantitative analysis. In this paper, a complete methodology is presented, that can more accurately capture the mechanics of CPSI without requiring unreasonable computation time for multiple design iterations. The methodology is a combination of experimental evaluation and numerical analysis. Both used iteratively achieve the intended purpose: reduce overall design time with less cost and design iterations giving quantitative- estimates. Each process step, starting from chip attach and ending with ball attach and board level assembly, was experimentally characterized for the 40nm silicon node Bill of Materials (BOM) and compared against numerical models. The iterative experimental correlation and the resulting model methodology are outlined in detail in this paper. Having experimentally validated the methodology, the effects of chip thickness, substrate thickness, bump design, underfill material, lid, stiffener and lid attachment on package warpage were determined and compared with experimental data. The corresponding impact of these factors on bump fatigue life and die level stresses was also determined. The relationship between board level assembly parameters and package and chip design variables was also determined. Finally, next generation on-demand cloud computing resources were used to further reduce computation times without sacrificing accuracy.

More specifically, we seek to study the impact of RPL's various parameters and external factors (e.g., various timers and speeds) on its performance and obtain insights on RPL tuning for its use in VANETs.\n\t\t"}, {"manu": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6248874&contentType=Conference+Publications&searchField%3DSearch_All%26queryText%3DAging+impact+on+the+accelerated+thermal+cycling+performance+of+lead-free+BGA+solder+joints+in+various+stress+conditions", "features": " \n\t\t\tageing; \n\t\t\tball grid arrays; \n\t\t\tfailure analysis; \n\t\t\tfatigue; \n\t\t\tmetallurgy; \n\t\t\tsolders; \n\t\t\taccelerated thermal cycling; \n\t\t\taging impact; \n\t\t\tbulk lead-free solders; \n\t\t\tfailure mode; \n\t\t\tfatigue life; \n\t\t\tintermetallic growth; \n\t\t\tisothermal aging effects; \n\t\t\tlead-free BGA solder joints; \n\t\t\tmechanical properties; \n\t\t\tsolder alloy metallurgies; \n\t\t\tstress conditions; \n\t\t\ttemperature 100 degC; \n\t\t\ttemperature 150 degC; \n\t\t\tAging; \n\t\t\tDegradation; \n\t\t\tIsothermal processes; \n\t\t\tMetals; \n\t\t\tMicrostructure; \n\t\t\tSoldering; \n\t\t\tStress;", "name": "Aging impact on the accelerated thermal cycling performance of lead-free BGA solder joints in various stress conditions", "author": "Tae-Kyu LeeHongtao Ma", "series_t": "May 29 2012-June 1 2012", "genre_s": "IEEE", "id": "978-1-4673-1966-9", "cat": "\n\t\t\tIsothermal aging effects on lead-free solders have been extensively investigated in recent studies for both bulk solders and package solder joints.

This paper presents a novel 3D IC architecture that includes a silicon interposer with Through-Silicon-Vias (TSV) and interconnect wiring layers on both sides of the silicon interposer. An ASIC chip measured at 22 mm \u00d7 18 mm \u00d7 0.4 mm is attached on top of the silicon interposer while two smaller memory chips with a size of 10 mm \u00d7 10 mm \u00d7 0.4 mm are attached to the bottom of the silicon interposer with micro-bump interconnections. A unique, double-sided Chip to Chip (C2C) joining process is developed to enable the ASIC and memory integration in true 3D System-in-Package (SiP) format. This 3D IC architecture will help to overcome the size limitation of the current silicon interposers due to the reticle size used in the lithographic wafer processing. The 3D IC stack is assembled on an organic package substrate with conventional solder bumps. Communications between the top ASIC die and the bottom memory dice are made through the TSVs and the wiring layers of the silicon interposer. Thermal and thermo-mechanical analysis of the 3D IC stack are used to evaluate the package thermal performance and for optimizing material selection and package reliability.

This paper embarks on a study consisting of both modeling and experimental cases to investigate how to accurately model fan failures. The study will include CFD simulations in different ways to model fan failures and also real life experimental measurements to verify the simulation concepts. Recommendations will then be made about the exact and accurate ways of modeling fan failures. The study also involves cases of fan failures for both front to back airflow (Pull Systems) and back to front airflow (Push Systems). Normally the fans have been modeled as two dimensional entities. The fan curve measured by the vendor is used in the fan during modeling. The problem that arises with this kind of a fan modeling especially during fan failures is that the three dimensional effect of the rotor and stator blades of the fan is not taken into account. In reality, the fan blades provide a big obstruction to the flow reversal that happens due to pressure imbalance during fan failures. In this paper, we start with modeling a single fan in an AMCA wind tunnel. The complete rotor and stator geometry of the fan is modeled. We run a MRF (Multiple Reference Frame) model to generate the fan curve for the fan and compare it with the experimental fan curve. After we validate the fan curve in an AMCA model for a single fan, the paper discusses three different sets of temperature and flow data: i. Temperature and flow data in a real system with four fans modeled with two dimensional fans ii. Temperature and flow data in a real system with four fans modeled with MRF fans (full 3 dimensional rotor and stator blade geometry) iii. Experimental comparisons with the simulated data.

Previous research in the area has focused on deriving a placement of monitors across the network towards the end of maximizing the monitoring utility of the network operator for a given traffic routing. However, both traffic characteristics and measurement objectives can dynamically change over time, rendering a previously optimal placement of monitors suboptimal. It is not feasible to dynamically redeploy/reconfigure measurement infrastructure to cater to such evolving measurement requirements. We address this problem by strategically routing traffic sub-populations over fixed monitors. We refer to this approach as MeasuRouting. The main challenge for MeasuRouting is to work within the constraints of existing intra-domain traffic engineering operations that are geared for efficiently utilizing bandwidth resources, or meeting Quality of Service (QoS) constraints, or both. A fundamental feature of intra-domain routing, that makes MeasuRouting feasible, is that intra-domain routing is often specified for aggregate flows.

Next generation ASIC's and SiP/MCM's are requiring packages in excess of 60mm \u00d7 60mm. These large package sizes present both significant manufacturability and reliability challenges. Developing new solutions which can adequately accommodate the needs of high speed interconnect while concurrently mitigating package size growth and the consequential reliability and manufacturability risks which result, is essential for maintaining a supply equilibrium at a sustainable cost. This paper discusses the manufacturing process and the component reliability of a large body size (55\u00d755mm) ASIC package TV using 40nm ELK Si technology and a Mixed Pitch Ball Grid Array (mpBGA) with BGA-side capacitance on both thin core (0.4mm) and 8+1 coreless substrates. Suitable for use at any body size, mpBGA combines tighter BGA pitch (0.94mm) and the option for BGA-side capacitance to enable optimal package decoupling and increased interconnect density. mpBGA provides a means for mitigating package size growth by inherently extending the usefulness of smaller package sizes, thereby minimizing both the package reliability risks as well as the cost associated with proving in the \u201cnext\u201d body size up (i.e increasing from 55\u00d755mm to 60\u00d760mm packages). The preferred method for assembly and design of mpBGA packages on both coreless and thin core substrates will be discussed including: (1) assembly process capability, (2) preferred board level design stack-up and (3) preferred package design footprint incorporating the BGA-side capacitors. A preferred BOM has been identified for the thin-core 55\u00d755mm package which has resulted in full-pass of all relevant L1 reliability tests (MSL-4 preconditioning, HTS, uHAST and 1000TCB).

For the molding compound, two material properties, pH level and C1-concentration are varied and a total of 9 formulations are generated.

Studies have concluded that the risk for pad cratering is elevated as the industry transitions to lead-free assemblies. In the past, characterization of pad cratering resistance has been problematic because typical board level reliability tests rely on monitoring the electrical resistance of daisy chain components. However, it has been known for some time that the initiation of pad cratering failures does not result in an instantaneous rise in electrical resistance. Therefore several studies have highlighted the need for a board-level methodology to detect the onset of pad cratering. In our recent study a new approach based on monitoring acoustic emission (AE) was introduced. It was shown that in comparison with conventional electrical resistance monitoring, the acoustic method is able to detect the onset of pad cratering failures in board-level mechanical bending tests. This paper builds upon our recent work by evaluating the effects of several variables on the propensity for pad cratering. The tests have been conducted on 1 mm pitch HSBGA, 1 mm pitch FCBGA and 0.8 mm pitch CABGA packages.

The prevalence of multicore chips ameliorates the stress on processing power, but the QoS guarantee is often ignored. In addition, results of legacy QoS studies are difficult to apply to multicore web servers. Therefore, a multicore scheduler that incorporates QoS concerns is missing. As the network development moves towards cloud computing, we see an increasing importance of QoS guarantees on high performance multicore network appliances. In this paper, we propose a proportional share hash based scheduler, PS-HRW, which extends existing optimizations in multicore scheduling with QoS concerns. We address the network QoS requirement by assigning weights to each connection following the classic General Processor Sharing (GPS) theory. Based on our previous multicore scheduling studies, PS-HRW allocates computing resources based on the QoS requirement, such that the workload is balanced at the packet level, and the connection locality is maintained. To provide accurate QoS guarantee, PS-HRW allocates an integral number of cores first and then allocates the residuals using a partitioning theory. However, different from traditional simulation based approach, we target at two popular applications on modern network appliances: Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) and multimedia transcoding. In addition, we generalize the topology of different multicore architectures into a communication matrix and optimize PS-HRW to incorporate cache awareness. Essentially, PS-HRW schedules incoming traffic efficiently by balancing between connection locality, load balancing, core/cache topology and QoS guarantees.\n\t\t"}, {"manu": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5963324&contentType=Conference+Publications&searchField%3DSearch_All%26queryText%3DOn+the+User-Centric+Connection+Availability+of+Mobile+Wireless+Networks", "features": " \n\t\t\tMarkov processes; \n\t\t\tmobile radio; \n\t\t\ttelecommunication congestion control; \n\t\t\tMarkov renewal process; \n\t\t\tasymptotic bound; \n\t\t\taverage speed; \n\t\t\tend user; \n\t\t\tmobile wireless network; \n\t\t\tmobility; \n\t\t\tneighbor connection time; \n\t\t\tneighbor isolation time; \n\t\t\tnode density; \n\t\t\ttransmission range; \n\t\t\tuser connectivity; \n\t\t\tuser-centric connection availability; \n\t\t\tAvailability; \n\t\t\tMarkov processes; \n\t\t\tMeasurement; \n\t\t\tMobile communication; \n\t\t\tMobile computing; \n\t\t\tPeer to peer computing; \n\t\t\tWireless networks;", "name": "On the User-Centric Connection Availability of Mobile Wireless Networks", "author": "Fei XingWenye Wang", "series_t": "5-9 June 2011", "genre_s": "IEEE", "id": "978-1-61284-232-5", "cat": "\n\t\t\tIn this paper we study the connection availability of wireless networks from the perspective of end users with individual mobility, in contrast to existing studies mainly focusing on network-centric connectivity.

The test vehicle was designed to capture the reliability impact of rework processes on interconnects of BGA devices, the solder joints of its adjacent components and BGA devices of clamshelled devices. The effects on high aspect ratio plated through hole (PTH) vias and microvias were also considered. A variety of BGA packages, such as FCBGA, PBGA, CABGA, etc. were selected to represent different package technologies and stress levels. The effects of multiple reworks on accelerated thermal cycling (ATC) of lead-free solder joints are extensively explored in this study The experimental and analytical findings showed that multiple reworks significantly degraded the ATC performance of the reworked assemblies by up to 50% in terms of characteristic life. It was also found that multiple reworks affect the PTH vias significantly. The combination of increased lead-free rework temperature excursions and high-end PCB aspect ratios may incur higher stresses in the PTH copper barrel. Early failures were observed post multiple reworks and the subsequent ATC test due to PTH barrel cracking. However, the effects of multiple reworks are less severe for devices with microvias compared to that with PTH vias. Multiple reworks also caused severe degradation of long term performance of devices with clamshell designs. With proper control in rework process, multiple reworks have minimum effects on the adjacent BGA solder joints. In addition, failure analysis was performed in order to study the impact of multiple rework on the microstructure of SnAgCu solder joints. It was found that the IMC layer grows thicker as the number of reworks increases; however, the IMC growth rate and morphology are dependent on the surface finish of the package substrate.

Researches show that aging effects significantly degrade the mechanical properties of lead-free solders. However, limited work has been done on the effects of aging on the board-level dynamic performance of lead-free solder joints, especially for large flip-chip ball grid array (FCBGA) packages. Due to the sensitivity of aging effects on lead-free solders, it is crucial to investigate the aging effects on the board-level dynamic performance of lead-free solders. In this paper, dynamic performance of lead-free solder joints has been characterized and isothermal aging effects have been investigated. It was found that the dynamic shock performance of lead-free FCBGA packages significantly degrades up to 20-35% after aging at elevated temperatures. It was also observed that aging at 100\u00b0C shows more severe degradation than aging at 75\u00b0C and 150\u00b0C. This is an important finding because many electronic products operate in the 100\u00b0C range for long periods. The unique finding of aging effects is related to the growth of Cu3Sn and Cu6Sn5 intermetallics after aging.

Traditional joint source/channel coding (JSCC) schemes for video multicast target a chosen th-percentile WWAN user. Users with poorer reception than th-percentile user (poor users) suffer substantial channel losses, while users with better reception (rich users) have more channel coding than necessary, resulting in sub-optimal video quality. In this paper, we recast the WWAN JSCC problem in a new setting called cooperative peer-to-peer repair (CPR), where users have both WWAN and wireless local area network (WLAN) interfaces and use the latter to exchange received WWAN packets locally. Given CPR can mitigate some WWAN losses via cooperative peer exchanges, a CPR-aware JSCC scheme can now allocate more bits to source coding to minimize source quantization noise without suffering more packet losses, leading to smaller overall visual distortion. Through CPR, this quality improvement is in fact reaped by all peers in the collective, not just a targeted th-percentile user. To efficiently implement both WWAN forward error correction and WLAN CPR repairs, we propose to use network coding for this dual purpose to reduce decoding complexity and maximize packet recovery at the peers. We show that a CPR-aware JSCC scheme dramatically improves video quality: by up to 8.7 dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio for the entire peer group over JSCC scheme without CPR, and by up to 6.0 dB over a CPR-ignorant JSCC scheme with CPR.\n\t\t"}, {"manu": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5744078&contentType=Early+Access+Articles&searchField%3DSearch_All%26queryText%3DQoS-Driven+Service+Composition+with+Reconfigurable+Services", "features": " \n\t\t\tdecision making; \n\t\t\tquality of service; \n\t\t\treconfigurable architectures; \n\t\t\tsearch problems; \n\t\t\tservice-oriented architecture; \n\t\t\tCDP; \n\t\t\tQoS-driven service composition; \n\t\t\tcompositional decision making process; \n\t\t\tconfiguration parameter settings; \n\t\t\tdecision space; \n\t\t\toptimal QoS-driven composition solutions; \n\t\t\tperformance gains; \n\t\t\trapid system composition; \n\t\t\trapid system deployment; \n\t\t\treconfigurable service modeling; \n\t\t\tsearch space reduction; \n\t\t\tservice composition decision making; \n\t\t\tservice-oriented architecture; \n\t\t\tsystem QoS requirements; \n\t\t\tAuthentication; \n\t\t\tConcrete; \n\t\t\tEncoding; \n\t\t\tMedia; \n\t\t\tQuality of service; \n\t\t\tXML; \n\t\t\tService-oriented architecture; \n\t\t\tquality of service (QoS); \n\t\t\treconfigurable services; \n\t\t\tservice composition;", "name": "QoS-Driven Service Composition with Reconfigurable Services", "author": "Hui MaBastani, F.I-Ling YenHong Mei", "series_t": "First Quarter 2013", "genre_s": "IEEE", "id": "1939-1374", "cat": "\n\t\t\tService-oriented architecture provides a framework for achieving rapid system composition and deployment. To satisfy different system QoS requirements, it is possible to select an appropriate set of concrete services and compose them to achieve the QoS goals. In addition, some of the services may be reconfigurable and provide various QoS tradeoffs. To make use of these reconfigurable services, the composition process should consider not only service selection, but also configuration parameter settings. However, existing QoS-driven service composition research does not consider reconfigurable services. Moreover, the decision space may be enormous when reconfigurable services are considered. In this paper, we deal with the issues of reconfigurable service modeling and efficient service composition decision making.

Since TCP does not explicitly account for this, starvation and unfairness can result from the use of TCP over such networks. In this paper, we explore mechanisms for achieving fair and efficient congestion control for multihop wireless mesh networks. First, we design an AIMD-based rate-control protocol called Wireless Control Protocol (WCP), which recognizes that wireless congestion is a neighborhood phenomenon, not a node-local one, and appropriately reacts to such congestion. Second, we design a distributed rate controller that estimates the available capacity within each neighborhood and divides this capacity to contending flows, a scheme we call Wireless Control Protocol with Capacity estimation (WCPCap). Using analysis, simulations, and real deployments, we find that our designs yield rates that are both fair and efficient. WCP assigns rates inversely proportional to the number of bottlenecks a flow passes through while remaining extremely easy to implement. An idealized version of WCPCap is max-min fair, whereas a practical implementation of the scheme achieves rates within 15% of the max-min optimal rates while still being distributed and amenable to real implementation.\n\t\t"}, {"manu": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898565&contentType=Conference+Publications&searchField%3DSearch_All%26queryText%3DImpact+of+isothermal+aging+on+Sn-Ag-Cu+solder+interconnect+board+level+high+G+mechanical+shock+performance", "features": " \n\t\t\tcopper; \n\t\t\tintegrated circuit interconnections; \n\t\t\tmasks; \n\t\t\tmechanical stability; \n\t\t\tsilver; \n\t\t\tsolders; \n\t\t\ttin; \n\t\t\tAg; \n\t\t\tCu; \n\t\t\tSn; \n\t\t\tisothermal aging; \n\t\t\tjoint stability; \n\t\t\tmechanical shock performance; \n\t\t\tmechanical stability; \n\t\t\tsolder interconnect board level; \n\t\t\tsolder mask; \n\t\t\tAging; \n\t\t\tElectric shock; \n\t\t\tIsothermal processes; \n\t\t\tJoints; \n\t\t\tMicrostructure; \n\t\t\tScanning electron microscopy; \n\t\t\tStrain;", "name": "Impact of isothermal aging on Sn-Ag-Cu solder interconnect board level high G mechanical shock performance", "author": "Tae-Kyu LeeWeidong XieKuo-Chuan Liu", "series_t": "May 31 2011-June 3 2011", "genre_s": "IEEE", "id": "978-1-61284-497-8", "cat": "\n\t\t\tThe mechanical stability of solder joints with Sn-Ag-Cu was an issue since the material was applied to the consumer electronic field.

Ideally, such a scheme should handle both persistent and transient congestion as video streaming applications demand low-latency transmissions and low packet-loss ratios. This paper presents a novel scheme, layered Internet video adaptation (LIVA), in which network nodes feed back virtual congestion levels to video senders to assist both media-aware bandwidth sharing and transient-loss protection. The video senders respond to such feedback by adapting the rates of encoded scalable bitstreams based on their respective video rate-distortion (R-D) characteristics. The same feedback is employed to calculate the amount of forward error correction (FEC) protection for combating transient losses. Simulation studies show that LIVA can minimize the total distortion of all participating video streams and hence maximize their overall quality. At steady state, video streams experience no queueing delays or packet losses. In the face of transient congestion, the network-assisted adaptive FEC promptly protects video packets from losses. Our Linux-based demonstration showcases how LIVA can be implemented in a simple manner in real systems. We also present a solution for LIVA streams to coexist with TCP flows based on explicit congestion notification signaling. Finally, our theoretical analysis guarantees system stability for an arbitrary number of streams with round-trip delays below a prescribed limit.\n\t\t"}, {"manu": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5780224&contentType=Conference+Publications&searchField%3DSearch_All%26queryText%3DAutomatic+Particle+Picking+from+Cryo-Electron+Microscopy+Images+by+Using+Partial+Least+Squares", "features": " \n\t\t\tbiological techniques; \n\t\t\tbiology computing; \n\t\t\tbiothermics; \n\t\t\tfeature extraction; \n\t\t\timage reconstruction; \n\t\t\tleast squares approximations; \n\t\t\tmolecular biophysics; \n\t\t\ttransmission electron microscopy; \n\t\t\t3D reconstruction; \n\t\t\tautomatic particle picking; \n\t\t\tcomputer screen; \n\t\t\tcryoelectron microscopy images; \n\t\t\tmicrographs; \n\t\t\tpartial least squares; \n\t\t\tparticle selection; \n\t\t\tprojections; \n\t\t\tsingle-particle analysis; \n\t\t\tthree-dimensional structure; \n\t\t\tBiology; \n\t\t\tFeature extraction; \n\t\t\tImage reconstruction; \n\t\t\tMicroscopy; \n\t\t\tPrincipal component analysis; \n\t\t\tThree dimensional displays; \n\t\t\tTraining;", "name": "Automatic Particle Picking from Cryo-Electron Microscopy Images by Using Partial Least Squares", "author": "Xiaorong Wu", "series_t": "10-12 May 2011", "genre_s": "IEEE", "id": "978-1-4244-5088-6", "cat": "\n\t\t\tSingle-particle analysis is a three-dimensional (3D) structure determining technique using electron microscopy.

Providing formal guarantees of the generated code with respect to the model, however, has turned out to be a hard problem. While the model is set in continuous time with concurrent execution and instantaneous switching, the code running on an inherently discrete platform, can be affected by the sampling interval, round-off errors, and communication delays between the sensor, controller, and actuators. Consequently, semantic differences between the model and its code can arise with potentially different system behavior.

These returns are most likely being caused by Single Event Upsets. The phenomenon of Single Event Upset (SEU) is a well known and documented and affects electronic circuitry. SEUs are caused by either atmospheric neutrons or alpha particles emitted by trace impurities in the silicon processing and packaging materials. SEUs could cause single or multiple bit errors in the components such as ASCIs, FPGAs, processors and memories. All of these components are susceptible to SEU, but in the traditional reliability analysis of products, these failures are not included. Reliability engineers calculate the failure rate for components based on hard failures and are totally discounting the Soft Error failures. In addition, when reliability engineers are performing availability modeling and failure allocation, SEUs are not included in their analysis.

First, we propose a novel semi-Markov process model to characterize the evolution of node behaviors. As an immediate application of the proposed model, we investigate the problem of node isolation where the effects of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks are considered. Then, we present the derivation of network survivability and obtain the lower and upper bounds on the topological survivability for k-connected networks. We find that the network survivability degrades very quickly with the increasing likelihood of node misbehaviors, depending on the requirements of disjoint outgoing paths or network connectivity. Moreover, DoS attacks have a significant impact on the network survivability, especially in dense networks.

In this paper, three frequency-dependent RLGC models are studied. One is the known frequency-dependent analytical RLGC model (RLGC-I), the second is the RLGC( f) model (RLGC-II) proposed in this paper, and the third (RLGC-III) is same as the RLGC -II, but with causality enforced by the Hilbert transform in frequency domain. The causalities of the three RLGC models are corroborated in the time domain by examining the propagation of a well-defined pulse through three different transmission lines: a single-ended stripline, a single-ended microstrip line, and an edge-coupled differential stripline pair.

Instead of proposing a distinct medium-access control (MAC) protocol for each type of application, we propose a family of parameterized MAC protocols called WiFlex, which can be tailored to different application needs, ranging from wireless sensors to media centers. However, these protocols allow communication and spectrum-sharing coordination among different types of devices. We envision this family to be based on a multichannel physical layer. The contributions of this paper include a novel asynchronous split phase (ASP) protocol with dynamic priority support, even in multiple-collision-domain environments. When links are bidirectional, WiFlex resolves the multichannel hidden-node problem, achieving collision-free data exchange in a multihop environment.

In this study, board level thermal cycle reliability tests have been performed on daisy chain lead-free 0.5 mm pitch CTBGA, 1.0 mm pitch PBGA, and 0.5 mm pitch MLF packages. The tests were performed with and without isothermal pre-aging. During the thermal cycling tests, the daisy chained solder joints were subjected to different levels of constant current density. The thermal cycle profiles were tailored in order to evaluate the effect of current density on solder joint fatigue, while minimizing the secondary effects of joule heating. The results show that the effects of both thermal aging and current stress are consistent for a given package type, but the trends can be different for different package designs. In 0.5 mm pitch CTBGA, isothermal aging significantly reduced the solder joint life, while current stress caused the solder joint life to slightly increase at moderate current densities, and eventually degrade at higher current densities.

First, in the LOS scenario, it addresses the issue of big swing of effective antenna gain due to non-continuous terrain data. Second, in the non-LOS situation, the effective antenna gain is integrated with shadow loss. Both single knife edge and multiple knife edge scenarios are discussed. The new algorithm is developed based on the analysis of measured and predicted (the theoretical shadow loss and effective antenna gain) data.

However, SAC solders are more brittle in nature due to high stiffness and excessive intermetallic compounds growth at the solder joint to pad interface. This leads to higher risks in solder joints failures. Memory module type lead-free BGA packages are constantly under dynamic stresses during handling and thermal stresses during operations. It is important to understand the dynamic performance and long term reliability of memory module lead-free BGAs. It is believed that the PCB design variations cause dynamic and long term failure discrepancies in the fields. In this study, different pad and trace designs were introduced to evaluate the effects of PCB design variations on the bend and Accelerate Thermal Cycling (ATC) performance of lead-free solder joints. Pad designs with NSMD (Non-solder mask defined), SMD (Solder mask defined), and a unique web design were assembled and tested. Different solder alloys including SAC305, SAC105, and SnPb solders, have been evaluated in this study. Different PCB materials have also been evaluated in the test. Four point monotonic bend tests were performed to characterize the bending performance variations with different PCB designs and compared with conventional Sn-Pb solder. SMD pad is shown to have the best bend performance among all other types of designs in this study. In addition, this design also shows improvement in mitigation of PCB pad cratering with lead-free solders. Wide trace width seems to degrade the strength and is not preferred. Same as its superior shock resistance comparing with SAC305, SAC105 solder alloy shows better bend performance. There is no significant improvement of bend performance with Web Design. After aging treatment, bend performance of both SAC305 and SAC105 degraded by up to 34% and 29% respectively. However, the bend performance of eutectic SnPb was actually improved- - after aging.

We can minimize the impedance profile by reducing power bus plane spacings, and by using local and global decoupling techniques that employ decoupling capacitors.

The ratio of leakage current to active current is also increasing for high performance silicon processes, as is the demand for more instantaneous switching current. Power integrity and power distribution design becomes a more prevalent issue in electrical design as it dictates the efficiency of current draw available to switch on-chip circuits. Silicon integration and device scaling still leads to overall higher performance, but there are practical limits to the yield and assembly reliability of very large die.

A baseline ASIC component was redesigned and fabricated into (1) a hybrid package placing the baseline ASIC onto a customized interposer board fabricated with both conventional and advanced high-capacitance laminate systems (2) a package utilizing a conventional substrate having capacitors interspersed between the BGA-balls, (3) a package utilizing an organic substrate with an embedded bulk array capacitor, and (4) a package using a coreless substrate. The bare substrates and ASIC component were assembled through conventional high volume processes whenever possible. The ASIC components were then assembled onto line cards using conventional board level assembly parameters and techniques. Electrical and reliability testing were performed at both device level and product level. For electrical measurement, improvements to the PDN were quantified by measuring the power rail noise and clock jitter and comparing each package variant to the performance of the baseline ASIC. The package design, signal routing, device, and system, assembly and test environments are essentially unchanged; the differences are attributed primarily to the substrate and package technology itself.

While process steps are designed to apply the lowest force possible on components, excessive load can be introduced by unexpected events such as machine malfunction or accidental external impact. For over-molded packages, particularly for packages with a large die and thin mold cap thickness, protection for such abnormal impact is reduced and even low levels of force can induce damage to the silicon. In this work, impact test is performed on two types of over-molded packages that have different die and package geometries. External load is applied on the top of the packages through the drop of a probe from different heights. The damages induced in the silicon are evaluated with ultrasonic scan and cross-section. The results from these analytical steps will help identify the threshold force for the die crack failures. A finite element model is constructed to simulate the impact test for one of the packages. The time-history of the load is analyzed and the maximum stress levels in the silicon for the different drop heights are compared. Two different mold cap thicknesses are also simulated.

More interestingly, the encounter events collectively form a robust communication network, in which store-carry-forward message dissemination can be successful even with over 20 percent noncooperative nodes or removal of short-lived (up to minutes) encounter events.\n\t\t"}, {"manu": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5556538&contentType=Conference+Publications&searchField%3DSearch_All%26queryText%3DTransforming+telemedicine+for+rural+and+urban+communities+Telemedicine+2.0+-+any+doctor%2C+any+place%2C+any+time", "features": " \n\t\t\tbiomedical telemetry; \n\t\t\tcomputer centres; \n\t\t\thealth care; \n\t\t\tteleconferencing; \n\t\t\ttelemedicine; \n\t\t\tvideo communication; \n\t\t\taudio telemetry; \n\t\t\tdata center; \n\t\t\thigh definition videoconferencing; \n\t\t\thigh quality video telemetry; \n\t\t\tintelligent transport; \n\t\t\tquality healthcare; \n\t\t\trural communities; \n\t\t\ttelemedicine 2.0; \n\t\t\turban communities; \n\t\t\tBiomedical monitoring; \n\t\t\tFacsimile; \n\t\t\tMedical services; \n\t\t\tMonitoring; \n\t\t\tMultiprotocol label switching; \n\t\t\tTV; \n\t\t\tWide area networks; \n\t\t\tHealthcare; \n\t\t\tHigh Definition; \n\t\t\tQoS; \n\t\t\tTelemedicine; \n\t\t\tTelemetry; \n\t\t\tVideoconference;", "name": "Transforming telemedicine for rural and urban communities Telemedicine 2.0 - any doctor, any place, any time", "author": "Wen-Pai LuLeung, H.Estrada, E.", "series_t": "1-3 July 2010", "genre_s": "IEEE", "id": "978-1-4244-6374-9", "cat": "\n\t\t\tProviding quality healthcare in both rural and urban settings introduces many challenges.

We describe the intelligent system components used at the end points and in the data center, and the requirements for a robust network both in the enterprise and in the service provider arenas.

The video senders respond to such feedback by adapting the rates of encoded H.264/SVC streams based on their respective video rate-distortion (R-D) characteristics. The same feedback is employed to calculate the amount of forward error correction (FEC) protection for combating transient losses. Simulation studies show that LIVE can minimize the total distortion of all participating video streams and hence maximize their overall quality. At steady state, video streams experience no queuing delays or packet losses. In face of transient congestion, the network-assisted adaptive FEC effectively protect video packets from losses while keeping a minimum overhead. Our theoretical analysis further guarantees system stability for arbitrary number of streams with arbitrary round trip delays below a prescribed limit. Finally, we show that LIVE streams can coexist with TCP flows within the existing explicit congestion notification (ECN) framework.\n\t\t"}, {"manu": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5490777&contentType=Conference+Publications&searchField%3DSearch_All%26queryText%3DPb-free+solder+joint+reliability+of+fine+pitch+chip-scale+packages", "features": " \n\t\t\tAging; \n\t\t\tAssembly; \n\t\t\tChip scale packaging; \n\t\t\tElectronics packaging; \n\t\t\tFoot; \n\t\t\tGrain size; \n\t\t\tIsothermal processes; \n\t\t\tLead; \n\t\t\tSoldering; \n\t\t\tStress;", "name": "Pb-free solder joint reliability of fine pitch chip-scale packages", "author": "Weidong XieTae-Kyu LeeKuo-Chuan LiuJie Xue", "series_t": "1-4 June 2010", "genre_s": "IEEE", "id": "978-1-4244-6410-4", "cat": "\n\t\t\tChip-scale package (CSP) is commonly seen on high density boards as it minimizes the foot print while packed more functionality into one component. Board level reliability concern over CSPs is that finer pitch limits the solder ball size attached and the stencil thickness used in assembly which leads to much smaller joint volume and standoff while larger die-to-package ratio typically means higher stress level caused by the CTE mismatch. Prior studies have shown that the grain orientation may impact SnAgCu solder joint reliability. With less solder volume, the joint reliability of fine pitch SnAgCu solder may be more sensitive to the grain size, grain orientation, and IMC formation within the bulk solder. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the board level reliability of Pb-free ball grid array (BGA) packages with ball pitch smaller than 0.5mm under different packaging and assembly conditions. Based on a test vehicle with 0.4mm pitch daisy-chained CVBGA, the impact on solder joint reliability from a wide spectrum of variables such as PCB thickness, SMT configuration, die size, package pad finish, and mini cycle profiling has been investigated. The results of this study enable us to better understand the Pb-free fine pitch joint behaviors under different conditions and the factors that have significant impact on joint reliability. Isothermal aging effect has also been studied, will be presented in a separated paper, which demonstrated that isothermal aging could significantly degrade joint reliability for fine pitch packages. The ATC results proved that the fine pitch packages may underperform the components with regular 0.8\u20131.0mm pitch therefore extra attention needs to be paid on fine pitch components while converting high reliability products to Pb-free.\n\t\t"}, {"manu": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5607341&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines&searchField%3DSearch_All%26queryText%3DWeighted+Fairness+and+Correct+Sizing+of+the+Secondary+Transit+Queue+in+Resilient+Packet+Rings", "features": " \n\t\t\tmetropolitan area networks; \n\t\t\tprotocols; \n\t\t\tqueueing theory; \n\t\t\ttelecommunication network topology; \n\t\t\twide area networks; \n\t\t\tIEEE 802.17; \n\t\t\tMAN; \n\t\t\tRPR protocol; \n\t\t\tWAN; wide area networks; \n\t\t\tcorrect sizing; \n\t\t\tresilient packet ring; \n\t\t\tresilient packet rings; \n\t\t\tsecondary transit queue; \n\t\t\tstandardized ring topology network architecture; \n\t\t\tweighted fairness; \n\t\t\tBandwidth; \n\t\t\tColor; \n\t\t\tInternet; \n\t\t\tOptimized production technology; \n\t\t\tSONET; \n\t\t\tServers; \n\t\t\tThroughput; \n\t\t\tFairness; \n\t\t\tMAN; \n\t\t\tRing networks; \n\t\t\tSpatial reuse; \n\t\t\tWAN;", "name": "Weighted Fairness and Correct Sizing of the Secondary Transit Queue in Resilient Packet Rings", "author": "Yilmaz, M.Ansari, N.", "series_t": "November 2010", "genre_s": "IEEE", "id": "1943-0620", "cat": "\n\t\t\tThe IEEE 802.17 is a standardized ring topology network architecture, called the Resilient Packet Ring (RPR), to be used mainly in metropolitan and wide area networks.

As demonstrated in several simple examples, equations used in information theory can help to calculate the information quantity generated from a test case, and use it as a measurement to improve testing processes.
